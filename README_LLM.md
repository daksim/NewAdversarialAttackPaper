**SubmitDate**: 2024-10-30    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22888v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.22888v1)

**Authors**: Youcheng Huang, Fengbin Zhu, Jingkun Tang, Pan Zhou, Wenqiang Lei, Jiancheng Lv, Tat-Seng Chua

**Abstract**: Visual Language Models (VLMs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially those from adversarial images, which is however under-explored in literature. To facilitate research on this critical safety problem, we first construct a new laRge-scale Adervsarial images dataset with Diverse hArmful Responses (RADAR), given that existing datasets are either small-scale or only contain limited types of harmful responses. With the new RADAR dataset, we further develop a novel and effective iN-time Embedding-based AdveRSarial Image DEtection (NEARSIDE) method, which exploits a single vector that distilled from the hidden states of VLMs, which we call the attacking direction, to achieve the detection of adversarial images against benign ones in the input. Extensive experiments with two victim VLMs, LLaVA and MiniGPT-4, well demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and cross-model transferrability of our proposed method.

**Abstract**: We reveal the theoretical foundations of techniques for editing large language models, and present new methods which can do so without requiring retraining. Our theoretical insights show that a single metric (a measure of the intrinsic dimension of the model's features) can be used to assess a model's editability and reveals its previously unrecognised susceptibility to malicious stealth attacks. This metric is fundamental to predicting the success of a variety of editing approaches, and reveals new bridges between disparate families of editing methods. We collectively refer to these as stealth editing methods, because they directly update a model's weights to specify its response to specific known hallucinating prompts without affecting other model behaviour. By carefully applying our theoretical insights, we are able to introduce a new jet-pack network block which is optimised for highly selective model editing, uses only standard network operations, and can be inserted into existing networks. We also reveal the vulnerability of language models to stealth attacks: a small change to a model's weights which fixes its response to a single attacker-chosen prompt. Stealth attacks are computationally simple, do not require access to or knowledge of the model's training data, and therefore represent a potent yet previously unrecognised threat to redistributed foundation models. Extensive experimental results illustrate and support our methods and their theoretical underpinnings. Demos and source code are available at https://github.com/qinghua-zhou/stealth-edits.

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2024-10-30    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22832v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.22832v1)

**Authors**: Yucheng Zhang, Qinfeng Li, Tianyu Du, Xuhong Zhang, Xinkui Zhao, Zhengwen Feng, Jianwei Yin

**Abstract**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge, making them adaptable and cost-effective for various applications. However, the growing reliance on these systems also introduces potential security risks. In this work, we reveal a novel vulnerability, the retrieval prompt hijack attack (HijackRAG), which enables attackers to manipulate the retrieval mechanisms of RAG systems by injecting malicious texts into the knowledge database. When the RAG system encounters target questions, it generates the attacker's pre-determined answers instead of the correct ones, undermining the integrity and trustworthiness of the system. We formalize HijackRAG as an optimization problem and propose both black-box and white-box attack strategies tailored to different levels of the attacker's knowledge. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that HijackRAG consistently achieves high attack success rates, outperforming existing baseline attacks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the attack is transferable across different retriever models, underscoring the widespread risk it poses to RAG systems. Lastly, our exploration of various defense mechanisms reveals that they are insufficient to counter HijackRAG, emphasizing the urgent need for more robust security measures to protect RAG systems in real-world deployments.



## **4. InjecGuard: Benchmarking and Mitigating Over-defense in Prompt Injection Guardrail Models**

cs.CL

**SubmitDate**: 2024-10-30    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22770v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.22770v1)

**Authors**: Hao Li, Xiaogeng Liu, Chaowei Xiao

**Abstract**: Prompt injection attacks pose a critical threat to large language models (LLMs), enabling goal hijacking and data leakage. Prompt guard models, though effective in defense, suffer from over-defense -- falsely flagging benign inputs as malicious due to trigger word bias. To address this issue, we introduce NotInject, an evaluation dataset that systematically measures over-defense across various prompt guard models. NotInject contains 339 benign samples enriched with trigger words common in prompt injection attacks, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Our results show that state-of-the-art models suffer from over-defense issues, with accuracy dropping close to random guessing levels (60%). To mitigate this, we propose InjecGuard, a novel prompt guard model that incorporates a new training strategy, Mitigating Over-defense for Free (MOF), which significantly reduces the bias on trigger words. InjecGuard demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on diverse benchmarks including NotInject, surpassing the existing best model by 30.8%, offering a robust and open-source solution for detecting prompt injection attacks. The code and datasets are released at https://github.com/SaFoLab-WISC/InjecGuard.



## **5. Uncovering Coordinated Cross-Platform Information Operations Threatening the Integrity of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election Online Discussion**

**SubmitDate**: 2024-10-30    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15402v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15402v2)

**Authors**: Marco Minici, Luca Luceri, Federico Cinus, Emilio Ferrara

**Abstract**: Information Operations (IOs) pose a significant threat to the integrity of democratic processes, with the potential to influence election-related online discourse. In anticipation of the 2024 U.S. presidential election, we present a study aimed at uncovering the digital traces of coordinated IOs on $\mathbb{X}$ (formerly Twitter). Using our machine learning framework for detecting online coordination, we analyze a dataset comprising election-related conversations on $\mathbb{X}$ from May 2024. This reveals a network of coordinated inauthentic actors, displaying notable similarities in their link-sharing behaviors. Our analysis shows concerted efforts by these accounts to disseminate misleading, redundant, and biased information across the Web through a coordinated cross-platform information operation: The links shared by this network frequently direct users to other social media platforms or suspicious websites featuring low-quality political content and, in turn, promoting the same $\mathbb{X}$ and YouTube accounts. Members of this network also shared deceptive images generated by AI, accompanied by language attacking political figures and symbolic imagery intended to convey power and dominance. While $\mathbb{X}$ has suspended a subset of these accounts, more than 75% of the coordinated network remains active. Our findings underscore the critical role of developing computational models to scale up the detection of threats on large social media platforms, and emphasize the broader implications of these techniques to detect IOs across the wider Web.



## **6. SVIP: Towards Verifiable Inference of Open-source Large Language Models**

cs.LG

20 pages

**SubmitDate**: 2024-10-29    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22307v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.22307v1)

**Authors**: Yifan Sun, Yuhang Li, Yue Zhang, Yuchen Jin, Huan Zhang

**Abstract**: Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, leading to widespread adoption across various domains. However, their increasing model sizes render local deployment impractical for individual users, pushing many to rely on computing service providers for inference through a blackbox API. This reliance introduces a new risk: a computing provider may stealthily substitute the requested LLM with a smaller, less capable model without consent from users, thereby delivering inferior outputs while benefiting from cost savings. In this paper, we formalize the problem of verifiable inference for LLMs. Existing verifiable computing solutions based on cryptographic or game-theoretic techniques are either computationally uneconomical or rest on strong assumptions. We introduce SVIP, a secret-based verifiable LLM inference protocol that leverages intermediate outputs from LLM as unique model identifiers. By training a proxy task on these outputs and requiring the computing provider to return both the generated text and the processed intermediate outputs, users can reliably verify whether the computing provider is acting honestly. In addition, the integration of a secret mechanism further enhances the security of our protocol. We thoroughly analyze our protocol under multiple strong and adaptive adversarial scenarios. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SVIP is accurate, generalizable, computationally efficient, and resistant to various attacks. Notably, SVIP achieves false negative rates below 5% and false positive rates below 3%, while requiring less than 0.01 seconds per query for verification.



## **7. Embedding-based classifiers can detect prompt injection attacks**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2024-10-29    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22284v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.22284v1)

**Authors**: Md. Ahsan Ayub, Subhabrata Majumdar

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are seeing significant adoption in every type of organization due to their exceptional generative capabilities. However, LLMs are found to be vulnerable to various adversarial attacks, particularly prompt injection attacks, which trick them into producing harmful or inappropriate content. Adversaries execute such attacks by crafting malicious prompts to deceive the LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on embedding-based Machine Learning (ML) classifiers to protect LLM-based applications against this severe threat. We leverage three commonly used embedding models to generate embeddings of malicious and benign prompts and utilize ML classifiers to predict whether an input prompt is malicious. Out of several traditional ML methods, we achieve the best performance with classifiers built using Random Forest and XGBoost. Our classifiers outperform state-of-the-art prompt injection classifiers available in open-source implementations, which use encoder-only neural networks.



## **8. AmpleGCG-Plus: A Strong Generative Model of Adversarial Suffixes to Jailbreak LLMs with Higher Success Rates in Fewer Attempts**

cs.CL

**SubmitDate**: 2024-10-29    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22143v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.22143v1)

**Authors**: Vishal Kumar, Zeyi Liao, Jaylen Jones, Huan Sun

**Abstract**: Although large language models (LLMs) are typically aligned, they remain vulnerable to jailbreaking through either carefully crafted prompts in natural language or, interestingly, gibberish adversarial suffixes. However, gibberish tokens have received relatively less attention despite their success in attacking aligned LLMs. Recent work, AmpleGCG~\citep{liao2024amplegcg}, demonstrates that a generative model can quickly produce numerous customizable gibberish adversarial suffixes for any harmful query, exposing a range of alignment gaps in out-of-distribution (OOD) language spaces. To bring more attention to this area, we introduce AmpleGCG-Plus, an enhanced version that achieves better performance in fewer attempts. Through a series of exploratory experiments, we identify several training strategies to improve the learning of gibberish suffixes. Our results, verified under a strict evaluation setting, show that it outperforms AmpleGCG on both open-weight and closed-source models, achieving increases in attack success rate (ASR) of up to 17\% in the white-box setting against Llama-2-7B-chat, and more than tripling ASR in the black-box setting against GPT-4. Notably, AmpleGCG-Plus jailbreaks the newer GPT-4o series of models at similar rates to GPT-4, and, uncovers vulnerabilities against the recently proposed circuit breakers defense. We publicly release AmpleGCG-Plus along with our collected training datasets.



## **9. Watch Out for Your Agents! Investigating Backdoor Threats to LLM-Based Agents**

**Authors**: Wenkai Yang, Xiaohan Bi, Yankai Lin, Sishuo Chen, Jie Zhou, Xu Sun

**Abstract**: Driven by the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have been developed to handle various real-world applications, including finance, healthcare, and shopping, etc. It is crucial to ensure the reliability and security of LLM-based agents during applications. However, the safety issues of LLM-based agents are currently under-explored. In this work, we take the first step to investigate one of the typical safety threats, backdoor attack, to LLM-based agents. We first formulate a general framework of agent backdoor attacks, then we present a thorough analysis of different forms of agent backdoor attacks. Specifically, compared with traditional backdoor attacks on LLMs that are only able to manipulate the user inputs and model outputs, agent backdoor attacks exhibit more diverse and covert forms: (1) From the perspective of the final attacking outcomes, the agent backdoor attacker can not only choose to manipulate the final output distribution, but also introduce the malicious behavior in an intermediate reasoning step only, while keeping the final output correct. (2) Furthermore, the former category can be divided into two subcategories based on trigger locations, in which the backdoor trigger can either be hidden in the user query or appear in an intermediate observation returned by the external environment. We implement the above variations of agent backdoor attacks on two typical agent tasks including web shopping and tool utilization. Extensive experiments show that LLM-based agents suffer severely from backdoor attacks and such backdoor vulnerability cannot be easily mitigated by current textual backdoor defense algorithms. This indicates an urgent need for further research on the development of targeted defenses against backdoor attacks on LLM-based agents. Warning: This paper may contain biased content.



## **10. Waterfall: Framework for Robust and Scalable Text Watermarking and Provenance for LLMs**

cs.CR

Accepted to EMNLP 2024 Main Conference

**SubmitDate**: 2024-10-29    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04411v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04411v2)

**Authors**: Gregory Kang Ruey Lau, Xinyuan Niu, Hieu Dao, Jiangwei Chen, Chuan-Sheng Foo, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low

**Abstract**: Protecting intellectual property (IP) of text such as articles and code is increasingly important, especially as sophisticated attacks become possible, such as paraphrasing by large language models (LLMs) or even unauthorized training of LLMs on copyrighted text to infringe such IP. However, existing text watermarking methods are not robust enough against such attacks nor scalable to millions of users for practical implementation. In this paper, we propose Waterfall, the first training-free framework for robust and scalable text watermarking applicable across multiple text types (e.g., articles, code) and languages supportable by LLMs, for general text and LLM data provenance. Waterfall comprises several key innovations, such as being the first to use LLM as paraphrasers for watermarking along with a novel combination of techniques that are surprisingly effective in achieving robust verifiability and scalability. We empirically demonstrate that Waterfall achieves significantly better scalability, robust verifiability, and computational efficiency compared to SOTA article-text watermarking methods, and showed how it could be directly applied to the watermarking of code. We also demonstrated that Waterfall can be used for LLM data provenance, where the watermarks of LLM training data can be detected in LLM output, allowing for detection of unauthorized use of data for LLM training and potentially enabling model-centric watermarking of open-sourced LLMs which has been a limitation of existing LLM watermarking works.

## **11. Enhancing Adversarial Attacks through Chain of Thought**

cs.CL

**SubmitDate**: 2024-10-29    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21791v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21791v1)

**Authors**: Jingbo Su

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various domains but remain susceptible to safety concerns. Prior research indicates that gradient-based adversarial attacks are particularly effective against aligned LLMs and the chain of thought (CoT) prompting can elicit desired answers through step-by-step reasoning. This paper proposes enhancing the robustness of adversarial attacks on aligned LLMs by integrating CoT prompts with the greedy coordinate gradient (GCG) technique. Using CoT triggers instead of affirmative targets stimulates the reasoning abilities of backend LLMs, thereby improving the transferability and universality of adversarial attacks. We conducted an ablation study comparing our CoT-GCG approach with Amazon Web Services auto-cot. Results revealed our approach outperformed both the baseline GCG attack and CoT prompting. Additionally, we used Llama Guard to evaluate potentially harmful interactions, providing a more objective risk assessment of entire conversations compared to matching outputs to rejection phrases.

## **12. Vaccine: Perturbation-aware Alignment for Large Language Models against Harmful Fine-tuning Attack**

cs.LG

Rejected by ICML2024. Accepted by NeurIPS2024

**SubmitDate**: 2024-10-29    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01109v5) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01109v5)

**Authors**: Tiansheng Huang, Sihao Hu, Ling Liu

**Abstract**: The new paradigm of finetuning-as-a-service introduces a new attack surface for Large Language Models (LLMs): a few harmful data uploaded by users can easily trick the finetuning to produce an alignment-broken model. We conduct an empirical analysis and uncover a \textit{harmful embedding drift} phenomenon, showing a probable cause of the alignment-broken effect. Inspired by our findings, we propose Vaccine, a perturbation-aware alignment technique to mitigate the security risk of users finetuning. The core idea of Vaccine is to produce invariant hidden embeddings by progressively adding crafted perturbation to them in the alignment phase. This enables the embeddings to withstand harmful perturbation from un-sanitized user data in the finetuning phase. Our results on open source mainstream LLMs (e.g., Llama2, Opt, Vicuna) demonstrate that Vaccine can boost the robustness of alignment against harmful prompts induced embedding drift while reserving reasoning ability towards benign prompts. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/git-disl/Vaccine}.



## **13. Harmful Fine-tuning Attacks and Defenses for Large Language Models: A Survey**

**Authors**: Tiansheng Huang, Sihao Hu, Fatih Ilhan, Selim Furkan Tekin, Ling Liu

**Abstract**: Recent research demonstrates that the nascent fine-tuning-as-a-service business model exposes serious safety concerns -- fine-tuning over a few harmful data uploaded by the users can compromise the safety alignment of the model. The attack, known as harmful fine-tuning, has raised a broad research interest among the community. However, as the attack is still new, \textbf{we observe from our miserable submission experience that there are general misunderstandings within the research community.} We in this paper aim to clear some common concerns for the attack setting, and formally establish the research problem. Specifically, we first present the threat model of the problem, and introduce the harmful fine-tuning attack and its variants. Then we systematically survey the existing literature on attacks/defenses/mechanical analysis of the problem. Finally, we outline future research directions that might contribute to the development of the field. Additionally, we present a list of questions of interest, which might be useful to refer to when reviewers in the peer review process question the realism of the experiment/attack/defense setting. A curated list of relevant papers is maintained and made accessible at: \url{https://github.com/git-disl/awesome_LLM-harmful-fine-tuning-papers}.



## **14. Lisa: Lazy Safety Alignment for Large Language Models against Harmful Fine-tuning Attack**

cs.LG

Accepted by NeurIPS2024. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap  with arXiv:2402.01109

**SubmitDate**: 2024-10-29    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18641v5) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.18641v5)

**Authors**: Tiansheng Huang, Sihao Hu, Fatih Ilhan, Selim Furkan Tekin, Ling Liu

**Abstract**: Recent studies show that Large Language Models (LLMs) with safety alignment can be jail-broken by fine-tuning on a dataset mixed with harmful data. First time in the literature, we show that the jail-broken effect can be mitigated by separating states in the finetuning stage to optimize the alignment and user datasets. Unfortunately, our subsequent study shows that this simple Bi-State Optimization (BSO) solution experiences convergence instability when steps invested in its alignment state is too small, leading to downgraded alignment performance. By statistical analysis, we show that the \textit{excess drift} towards consensus could be a probable reason for the instability. To remedy this issue, we propose \textbf{L}azy(\textbf{i}) \textbf{s}afety \textbf{a}lignment (\textbf{Lisa}), which introduces a proximal term to constraint the drift of each state. Theoretically, the benefit of the proximal term is supported by the convergence analysis, wherein we show that a sufficient large proximal factor is necessary to guarantee Lisa's convergence. Empirically, our results on four downstream finetuning tasks show that Lisa with a proximal term can significantly increase alignment performance while maintaining the LLM's accuracy on the user tasks. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/git-disl/Lisa}.



## **15. Fine-tuning Large Language Models for DGA and DNS Exfiltration Detection**

cs.CR

Accepted in Proceedings of the Workshop at AI for Cyber Threat  Intelligence (WAITI), 2024

**SubmitDate**: 2024-10-29    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21723v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21723v1)

**Authors**: Md Abu Sayed, Asif Rahman, Christopher Kiekintveld, Sebastian Garcia

**Abstract**: Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) are malicious techniques used by malware to dynamically generate seemingly random domain names for communication with Command & Control (C&C) servers. Due to the fast and simple generation of DGA domains, detection methods must be highly efficient and precise to be effective. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their proficiency in real-time detection tasks, making them ideal candidates for detecting DGAs. Our work validates the effectiveness of fine-tuned LLMs for detecting DGAs and DNS exfiltration attacks. We developed LLM models and conducted comprehensive evaluation using a diverse dataset comprising 59 distinct real-world DGA malware families and normal domain data. Our LLM model significantly outperformed traditional natural language processing techniques, especially in detecting unknown DGAs. We also evaluated its performance on DNS exfiltration datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing cybersecurity measures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that empirically applies LLMs for DGA and DNS exfiltration detection.



## **16. Bileve: Securing Text Provenance in Large Language Models Against Spoofing with Bi-level Signature**

cs.CR

NeurIPS 2024 camera-ready

**SubmitDate**: 2024-10-29    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01946v3) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.01946v3)

**Authors**: Tong Zhou, Xuandong Zhao, Xiaolin Xu, Shaolei Ren

**Abstract**: Text watermarks for large language models (LLMs) have been commonly used to identify the origins of machine-generated content, which is promising for assessing liability when combating deepfake or harmful content. While existing watermarking techniques typically prioritize robustness against removal attacks, unfortunately, they are vulnerable to spoofing attacks: malicious actors can subtly alter the meanings of LLM-generated responses or even forge harmful content, potentially misattributing blame to the LLM developer. To overcome this, we introduce a bi-level signature scheme, Bileve, which embeds fine-grained signature bits for integrity checks (mitigating spoofing attacks) as well as a coarse-grained signal to trace text sources when the signature is invalid (enhancing detectability) via a novel rank-based sampling strategy. Compared to conventional watermark detectors that only output binary results, Bileve can differentiate 5 scenarios during detection, reliably tracing text provenance and regulating LLMs. The experiments conducted on OPT-1.3B and LLaMA-7B demonstrate the effectiveness of Bileve in defeating spoofing attacks with enhanced detectability. Code is available at https://github.com/Tongzhou0101/Bileve-official.



## **17. CFSafety: Comprehensive Fine-grained Safety Assessment for LLMs**

cs.CL

**SubmitDate**: 2024-10-29    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21695v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21695v1)

**Authors**: Zhihao Liu, Chenhui Hu

**Abstract**: As large language models (LLMs) rapidly evolve, they bring significant conveniences to our work and daily lives, but also introduce considerable safety risks. These models can generate texts with social biases or unethical content, and under specific adversarial instructions, may even incite illegal activities. Therefore, rigorous safety assessments of LLMs are crucial. In this work, we introduce a safety assessment benchmark, CFSafety, which integrates 5 classic safety scenarios and 5 types of instruction attacks, totaling 10 categories of safety questions, to form a test set with 25k prompts. This test set was used to evaluate the natural language generation (NLG) capabilities of LLMs, employing a combination of simple moral judgment and a 1-5 safety rating scale for scoring. Using this benchmark, we tested eight popular LLMs, including the GPT series. The results indicate that while GPT-4 demonstrated superior safety performance, the safety effectiveness of LLMs, including this model, still requires improvement. The data and code associated with this study are available on GitHub.



## **18. FATH: Authentication-based Test-time Defense against Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2024-10-28    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21492v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21492v1)

**Authors**: Jiongxiao Wang, Fangzhou Wu, Wendi Li, Jinsheng Pan, Edward Suh, Z. Morley Mao, Muhao Chen, Chaowei Xiao

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed as the backbone with additional tools and text information for real-world applications. However, integrating external information into LLM-integrated applications raises significant security concerns. Among these, prompt injection attacks are particularly threatening, where malicious instructions injected in the external text information can exploit LLMs to generate answers as the attackers desire. While both training-time and test-time defense methods have been developed to mitigate such attacks, the unaffordable training costs associated with training-time methods and the limited effectiveness of existing test-time methods make them impractical. This paper introduces a novel test-time defense strategy, named Formatting AuThentication with Hash-based tags (FATH). Unlike existing approaches that prevent LLMs from answering additional instructions in external text, our method implements an authentication system, requiring LLMs to answer all received instructions with a security policy and selectively filter out responses to user instructions as the final output. To achieve this, we utilize hash-based authentication tags to label each response, facilitating accurate identification of responses according to the user's instructions and improving the robustness against adaptive attacks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our defense method can effectively defend against indirect prompt injection attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance under Llama3 and GPT3.5 models across various attack methods.

## **19. Simplicity Prevails: Rethinking Negative Preference Optimization for LLM Unlearning**

cs.CL

**SubmitDate**: 2024-10-28    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07163v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.07163v2)

**Authors**: Chongyu Fan, Jiancheng Liu, Licong Lin, Jinghan Jia, Ruiqi Zhang, Song Mei, Sijia Liu

**Abstract**: In this work, we address the problem of large language model (LLM) unlearning, aiming to remove unwanted data influences and associated model capabilities (e.g., copyrighted data or harmful content generation) while preserving essential model utilities, without the need for retraining from scratch. Despite the growing need for LLM unlearning, a principled optimization framework remains lacking. To this end, we revisit the state-of-the-art approach, negative preference optimization (NPO), and identify the issue of reference model bias, which could undermine NPO's effectiveness, particularly when unlearning forget data of varying difficulty. Given that, we propose a simple yet effective unlearning optimization framework, called SimNPO, showing that 'simplicity' in removing the reliance on a reference model (through the lens of simple preference optimization) benefits unlearning. We also provide deeper insights into SimNPO's advantages, supported by analysis using mixtures of Markov chains. Furthermore, we present extensive experiments validating SimNPO's superiority over existing unlearning baselines in benchmarks like TOFU and MUSE, and robustness against relearning attacks. Codes are available at https://github.com/OPTML-Group/Unlearn-Simple.



## **20. Securing Multi-turn Conversational Language Models From Distributed Backdoor Triggers**

cs.CL

Findings of EMNLP 2024

**SubmitDate**: 2024-10-28    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04151v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04151v2)

**Authors**: Terry Tong, Jiashu Xu, Qin Liu, Muhao Chen

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have acquired the ability to handle longer context lengths and understand nuances in text, expanding their dialogue capabilities beyond a single utterance. A popular user-facing application of LLMs is the multi-turn chat setting. Though longer chat memory and better understanding may seemingly benefit users, our paper exposes a vulnerability that leverages the multi-turn feature and strong learning ability of LLMs to harm the end-user: the backdoor. We demonstrate that LLMs can capture the combinational backdoor representation. Only upon presentation of triggers together does the backdoor activate. We also verify empirically that this representation is invariant to the position of the trigger utterance. Subsequently, inserting a single extra token into two utterances of 5%of the data can cause over 99% Attack Success Rate (ASR). Our results with 3 triggers demonstrate that this framework is generalizable, compatible with any trigger in an adversary's toolbox in a plug-and-play manner. Defending the backdoor can be challenging in the chat setting because of the large input and output space. Our analysis indicates that the distributed backdoor exacerbates the current challenges by polynomially increasing the dimension of the attacked input space. Canonical textual defenses like ONION and BKI leverage auxiliary model forward passes over individual tokens, scaling exponentially with the input sequence length and struggling to maintain computational feasibility. To this end, we propose a decoding time defense - decayed contrastive decoding - that scales linearly with assistant response sequence length and reduces the backdoor to as low as 0.35%.

**Abstract**: Generative AI agents, software systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are emerging as a promising approach to automate cybersecurity tasks. Among the others, penetration testing is a challenging field due to the task complexity and the diverse strategies to simulate cyber-attacks. Despite growing interest and initial studies in automating penetration testing with generative agents, there remains a significant gap in the form of a comprehensive and standard framework for their evaluation and development. This paper introduces AutoPenBench, an open benchmark for evaluating generative agents in automated penetration testing. We present a comprehensive framework that includes 33 tasks, each representing a vulnerable system that the agent has to attack. Tasks are of increasing difficulty levels, including in-vitro and real-world scenarios. We assess the agent performance with generic and specific milestones that allow us to compare results in a standardised manner and understand the limits of the agent under test. We show the benefits of AutoPenBench by testing two agent architectures: a fully autonomous and a semi-autonomous supporting human interaction. We compare their performance and limitations. For example, the fully autonomous agent performs unsatisfactorily achieving a 21% Success Rate (SR) across the benchmark, solving 27% of the simple tasks and only one real-world task. In contrast, the assisted agent demonstrates substantial improvements, with 64% of SR. AutoPenBench allows us also to observe how different LLMs like GPT-4o or OpenAI o1 impact the ability of the agents to complete the tasks. We believe that our benchmark fills the gap with a standard and flexible framework to compare penetration testing agents on a common ground. We hope to extend AutoPenBench along with the research community by making it available under https://github.com/lucagioacchini/auto-pen-bench.

**Abstract**: Releasing open-source large language models (LLMs) presents a dual-use risk since bad actors can easily fine-tune these models for harmful purposes. Even without the open release of weights, weight stealing and fine-tuning APIs make closed models vulnerable to harmful fine-tuning attacks (HFAs). While safety measures like preventing jailbreaks and improving safety guardrails are important, such measures can easily be reversed through fine-tuning. In this work, we propose Representation Noising (RepNoise), a defence mechanism that is effective even when attackers have access to the weights. RepNoise works by removing information about harmful representations such that it is difficult to recover them during fine-tuning. Importantly, our defence is also able to generalize across different subsets of harm that have not been seen during the defence process as long as they are drawn from the same distribution of the attack set. Our method does not degrade the general capability of LLMs and retains the ability to train the model on harmless tasks. We provide empirical evidence that the effectiveness of our defence lies in its "depth": the degree to which information about harmful representations is removed across all layers of the LLM.

**Authors**: Sahasra Kokkula, Somanathan R, Nandavardhan R, Aashishkumar, G Divya

**Abstract**: The advent of Large Language Models LLMs marks a milestone in Artificial Intelligence, altering how machines comprehend and generate human language. However, LLMs are vulnerable to malicious prompt injection attacks, where crafted inputs manipulate the models behavior in unintended ways, compromising system integrity and causing incorrect outcomes. Conventional detection methods rely on static, rule-based approaches, which often fail against sophisticated threats like abnormal token sequences and alias substitutions, leading to limited adaptability and higher rates of false positives and false negatives.This paper proposes a novel NLP based approach for prompt injection detection, emphasizing accuracy and optimization through a layered input screening process. In this framework, prompts are filtered through three distinct layers rule-based, ML classifier, and companion LLM before reaching the target model, thereby minimizing the risk of malicious interaction.Tests show the ML classifier achieves the highest accuracy among individual layers, yet the multi-layer framework enhances overall detection accuracy by reducing false negatives. Although this increases false positives, it minimizes the risk of overlooking genuine injected prompts, thus prioritizing security.This multi-layered detection approach highlights LLM vulnerabilities and provides a comprehensive framework for future research, promoting secure interactions between humans and AI systems.

**Authors**: Honglin Mu, Han He, Yuxin Zhou, Yunlong Feng, Yang Xu, Libo Qin, Xiaoming Shi, Zeming Liu, Xudong Han, Qi Shi, Qingfu Zhu, Wanxiang Che

**Abstract**: Large language model (LLM) safety is a critical issue, with numerous studies employing red team testing to enhance model security. Among these, jailbreak methods explore potential vulnerabilities by crafting malicious prompts that induce model outputs contrary to safety alignments. Existing black-box jailbreak methods often rely on model feedback, repeatedly submitting queries with detectable malicious instructions during the attack search process. Although these approaches are effective, the attacks may be intercepted by content moderators during the search process. We propose an improved transfer attack method that guides malicious prompt construction by locally training a mirror model of the target black-box model through benign data distillation. This method offers enhanced stealth, as it does not involve submitting identifiable malicious instructions to the target model during the search phase. Our approach achieved a maximum attack success rate of 92%, or a balanced value of 80% with an average of 1.5 detectable jailbreak queries per sample against GPT-3.5 Turbo on a subset of AdvBench. These results underscore the need for more robust defense mechanisms.

**Authors**: Piotr Przybyła

**Abstract**: We investigate the challenge of generating adversarial examples to test the robustness of text classification algorithms detecting low-credibility content, including propaganda, false claims, rumours and hyperpartisan news. We focus on simulation of content moderation by setting realistic limits on the number of queries an attacker is allowed to attempt. Within our solution (TREPAT), initial rephrasings are generated by large language models with prompts inspired by meaning-preserving NLP tasks, e.g. text simplification and style transfer. Subsequently, these modifications are decomposed into small changes, applied through beam search procedure until the victim classifier changes its decision. The evaluation confirms the superiority of our approach in the constrained scenario, especially in case of long input text (news articles), where exhaustive search is not feasible.

**Authors**: Dario Pasquini, Evgenios M. Kornaropoulos, Giuseppe Ateniese

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being harnessed to automate cyberattacks, making sophisticated exploits more accessible and scalable. In response, we propose a new defense strategy tailored to counter LLM-driven cyberattacks. We introduce Mantis, a defensive framework that exploits LLMs' susceptibility to adversarial inputs to undermine malicious operations. Upon detecting an automated cyberattack, Mantis plants carefully crafted inputs into system responses, leading the attacker's LLM to disrupt their own operations (passive defense) or even compromise the attacker's machine (active defense). By deploying purposefully vulnerable decoy services to attract the attacker and using dynamic prompt injections for the attacker's LLM, Mantis can autonomously hack back the attacker. In our experiments, Mantis consistently achieved over 95% effectiveness against automated LLM-driven attacks. To foster further research and collaboration, Mantis is available as an open-source tool: https://github.com/pasquini-dario/project_mantis

**Authors**: Zhihao Xu, Ruixuan Huang, Changyu Chen, Xiting Wang

**Abstract**: Despite careful safety alignment, current large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to various attacks. To further unveil the safety risks of LLMs, we introduce a Safety Concept Activation Vector (SCAV) framework, which effectively guides the attacks by accurately interpreting LLMs' safety mechanisms. We then develop an SCAV-guided attack method that can generate both attack prompts and embedding-level attacks with automatically selected perturbation hyperparameters. Both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate that our attack method significantly improves the attack success rate and response quality while requiring less training data. Additionally, we find that our generated attack prompts may be transferable to GPT-4, and the embedding-level attacks may also be transferred to other white-box LLMs whose parameters are known. Our experiments further uncover the safety risks present in current LLMs. For example, in our evaluation of seven open-source LLMs, we observe an average attack success rate of 99.14%, based on the classic keyword-matching criterion. Finally, we provide insights into the safety mechanism of LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/SproutNan/AI-Safety_SCAV.

**Authors**: Md Abdur Rahman, Fan Wu, Alfredo Cuzzocrea, Sheikh Iqbal Ahamed

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming a popular tool as they have significantly advanced in their capability to tackle a wide range of language-based tasks. However, LLMs applications are highly vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, which poses a critical problem. These attacks target LLMs applications through using carefully designed input prompts to divert the model from adhering to original instruction, thereby it could execute unintended actions. These manipulations pose serious security threats which potentially results in data leaks, biased outputs, or harmful responses. This project explores the security vulnerabilities in relation to prompt injection attacks. To detect whether a prompt is vulnerable or not, we follows two approaches: 1) a pre-trained LLM, and 2) a fine-tuned LLM. Then, we conduct a thorough analysis and comparison of the classification performance. Firstly, we use pre-trained XLM-RoBERTa model to detect prompt injections using test dataset without any fine-tuning and evaluate it by zero-shot classification. Then, this proposed work will apply supervised fine-tuning to this pre-trained LLM using a task-specific labeled dataset from deepset in huggingface, and this fine-tuned model achieves impressive results with 99.13\% accuracy, 100\% precision, 98.33\% recall and 99.15\% F1-score thorough rigorous experimentation and evaluation. We observe that our approach is highly efficient in detecting prompt injection attacks.



## **29. LLM Robustness Against Misinformation in Biomedical Question Answering**

**Authors**: Alexander Bondarenko, Adrian Viehweger

**Abstract**: The retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach is used to reduce the confabulation of large language models (LLMs) for question answering by retrieving and providing additional context coming from external knowledge sources (e.g., by adding the context to the prompt). However, injecting incorrect information can mislead the LLM to generate an incorrect answer.   In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of four LLMs against misinformation - Gemma 2, GPT-4o-mini, Llama~3.1, and Mixtral - in answering biomedical questions. We assess the answer accuracy on yes-no and free-form questions in three scenarios: vanilla LLM answers (no context is provided), "perfect" augmented generation (correct context is provided), and prompt-injection attacks (incorrect context is provided). Our results show that Llama 3.1 (70B parameters) achieves the highest accuracy in both vanilla (0.651) and "perfect" RAG (0.802) scenarios. However, the accuracy gap between the models almost disappears with "perfect" RAG, suggesting its potential to mitigate the LLM's size-related effectiveness differences.   We further evaluate the ability of the LLMs to generate malicious context on one hand and the LLM's robustness against prompt-injection attacks on the other hand, using metrics such as attack success rate (ASR), accuracy under attack, and accuracy drop. As adversaries, we use the same four LLMs (Gemma 2, GPT-4o-mini, Llama 3.1, and Mixtral) to generate incorrect context that is injected in the target model's prompt. Interestingly, Llama is shown to be the most effective adversary, causing accuracy drops of up to 0.48 for vanilla answers and 0.63 for "perfect" RAG across target models. Our analysis reveals that robustness rankings vary depending on the evaluation measure, highlighting the complexity of assessing LLM resilience to adversarial attacks.

**Authors**: Mishaal Kazmi, Hadrien Lautraite, Alireza Akbari, Qiaoyue Tang, Mauricio Soroco, Tao Wang, Sébastien Gambs, Mathias Lécuyer

**Abstract**: We present PANORAMIA, a privacy leakage measurement framework for machine learning models that relies on membership inference attacks using generated data as non-members. By relying on generated non-member data, PANORAMIA eliminates the common dependency of privacy measurement tools on in-distribution non-member data. As a result, PANORAMIA does not modify the model, training data, or training process, and only requires access to a subset of the training data. We evaluate PANORAMIA on ML models for image and tabular data classification, as well as on large-scale language models.

**Abstract**: The risk of harmful content generated by large language models (LLMs) becomes a critical concern. This paper presents a systematic study on assessing and improving LLMs' capability to perform the task of \textbf{course-correction}, \ie, the model can steer away from generating harmful content autonomously. To start with, we introduce the \textsc{C$^2$-Eval} benchmark for quantitative assessment and analyze 10 popular LLMs, revealing varying proficiency of current safety-tuned LLMs in course-correction. To improve, we propose fine-tuning LLMs with preference learning, emphasizing the preference for timely course-correction. Using an automated pipeline, we create \textsc{C$^2$-Syn}, a synthetic dataset with 750K pairwise preferences, to teach models the concept of timely course-correction through data-driven preference learning. Experiments on 2 LLMs, \textsc{Llama2-Chat 7B} and \textsc{Qwen2 7B}, show that our method effectively enhances course-correction skills without affecting general performance. Additionally, it effectively improves LLMs' safety, particularly in resisting jailbreak attacks.

**Authors**: Mingrui Liu, Sixiao Zhang, Cheng Long

**Abstract**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been an effective approach to mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) by incorporating up-to-date and domain-specific knowledge. Recently, there has been a trend of storing up-to-date or copyrighted data in RAG knowledge databases instead of using it for LLM training. This practice has raised concerns about Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which aim to detect if a specific target document is stored in the RAG system's knowledge database so as to protect the rights of data producers. While research has focused on enhancing the trustworthiness of RAG systems, existing MIAs for RAG systems remain largely insufficient. Previous work either relies solely on the RAG system's judgment or is easily influenced by other documents or the LLM's internal knowledge, which is unreliable and lacks explainability. To address these limitations, we propose a Mask-Based Membership Inference Attacks (MBA) framework. Our framework first employs a masking algorithm that effectively masks a certain number of words in the target document. The masked text is then used to prompt the RAG system, and the RAG system is required to predict the mask values. If the target document appears in the knowledge database, the masked text will retrieve the complete target document as context, allowing for accurate mask prediction. Finally, we adopt a simple yet effective threshold-based method to infer the membership of target document by analyzing the accuracy of mask prediction. Our mask-based approach is more document-specific, making the RAG system's generation less susceptible to distractions from other documents or the LLM's internal knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to existing baseline models.

**Abstract**: The large-scale deployment of Solidity smart contracts on the Ethereum mainnet has increasingly attracted financially-motivated attackers in recent years. A few now-infamous attacks in Ethereum's history includes DAO attack in 2016 (50 million dollars lost), Parity Wallet hack in 2017 (146 million dollars locked), Beautychain's token BEC in 2018 (900 million dollars market value fell to 0), and NFT gaming blockchain breach in 2022 ($600 million in Ether stolen). This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of the use of large language models (LLMs) and their capabilities in detecting OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities in Solidity. We introduce a novel, class-balanced, structured, and labeled dataset named VulSmart, which we use to benchmark and compare the performance of open-source LLMs such as CodeLlama, Llama2, CodeT5 and Falcon, alongside closed-source models like GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o Mini. Our proposed SmartVD framework is rigorously tested against these models through extensive automated and manual evaluations, utilizing BLEU and ROUGE metrics to assess the effectiveness of vulnerability detection in smart contracts. We also explore three distinct prompting strategies-zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought-to evaluate the multi-class classification and generative capabilities of the SmartVD framework. Our findings reveal that SmartVD outperforms its open-source counterparts and even exceeds the performance of closed-source base models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 Mini. After fine-tuning, the closed-source models, GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o Mini, achieved remarkable performance with 99% accuracy in detecting vulnerabilities, 94% in identifying their types, and 98% in determining severity. Notably, SmartVD performs best with the `chain-of-thought' prompting technique, whereas the fine-tuned closed-source models excel with the `zero-shot' prompting approach.

**Authors**: Poojitha Thota, Shirin Nilizadeh

**Abstract**: Large Language Models have introduced novel opportunities for text comprehension and generation. Yet, they are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations and data poisoning attacks, particularly in tasks like text classification and translation. However, the adversarial robustness of abstractive text summarization models remains less explored. In this work, we unveil a novel approach by exploiting the inherent lead bias in summarization models, to perform adversarial perturbations. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative application of influence functions, to execute data poisoning, which compromises the model's integrity. This approach not only shows a skew in the models behavior to produce desired outcomes but also shows a new behavioral change, where models under attack tend to generate extractive summaries rather than abstractive summaries.

**Authors**: Chung-En Sun, Xiaodong Liu, Weiwei Yang, Tsui-Wei Weng, Hao Cheng, Aidan San, Michel Galley, Jianfeng Gao

**Abstract**: Recent research has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to automated jailbreak attacks, where adversarial suffixes crafted by algorithms appended to harmful queries bypass safety alignment and trigger unintended responses. Current methods for generating these suffixes are computationally expensive and have low Attack Success Rates (ASR), especially against well-aligned models like Llama2 and Llama3. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ADV-LLM, an iterative self-tuning process that crafts adversarial LLMs with enhanced jailbreak ability. Our framework significantly reduces the computational cost of generating adversarial suffixes while achieving nearly 100\% ASR on various open-source LLMs. Moreover, it exhibits strong attack transferability to closed-source models, achieving 99% ASR on GPT-3.5 and 49% ASR on GPT-4, despite being optimized solely on Llama3. Beyond improving jailbreak ability, ADV-LLM provides valuable insights for future safety alignment research through its ability to generate large datasets for studying LLM safety.

**Authors**: Tanqiu Jiang, Zian Wang, Jiacheng Liang, Changjiang Li, Yuhui Wang, Ting Wang

**Abstract**: Jailbreak attacks circumvent LLMs' built-in safeguards by concealing harmful queries within jailbreak prompts. While existing defenses primarily focus on mitigating the effects of jailbreak prompts, they often prove inadequate as jailbreak prompts can take arbitrary, adaptive forms. This paper presents RobustKV, a novel defense that adopts a fundamentally different approach by selectively removing critical tokens of harmful queries from key-value (KV) caches. Intuitively, for a jailbreak prompt to be effective, its tokens must achieve sufficient `importance' (as measured by attention scores), which inevitably lowers the importance of tokens in the concealed harmful query. Thus, by strategically evicting the KVs of the lowest-ranked tokens, RobustKV diminishes the presence of the harmful query in the KV cache, thus preventing the LLM from generating malicious responses. Extensive evaluation using benchmark datasets and models demonstrates that RobustKV effectively counters state-of-the-art jailbreak attacks while maintaining the LLM's general performance on benign queries. Moreover, RobustKV creates an intriguing evasiveness dilemma for adversaries, forcing them to balance between evading RobustKV and bypassing the LLM's built-in safeguards. This trade-off contributes to RobustKV's robustness against adaptive attacks. (warning: this paper contains potentially harmful content generated by LLMs.)

**Authors**: Yige Li, Hanxun Huang, Jiaming Zhang, Xingjun Ma, Yu-Gang Jiang

**Abstract**: Backdoor attacks covertly implant triggers into deep neural networks (DNNs) by poisoning a small portion of the training data with pre-designed backdoor triggers. This vulnerability is exacerbated in the era of large models, where extensive (pre-)training on web-crawled datasets is susceptible to compromise. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-step defense framework named Expose Before You Defend (EBYD). EBYD unifies existing backdoor defense methods into a comprehensive defense system with enhanced performance. Specifically, EBYD first exposes the backdoor functionality in the backdoored model through a model preprocessing step called backdoor exposure, and then applies detection and removal methods to the exposed model to identify and eliminate the backdoor features. In the first step of backdoor exposure, we propose a novel technique called Clean Unlearning (CUL), which proactively unlearns clean features from the backdoored model to reveal the hidden backdoor features. We also explore various model editing/modification techniques for backdoor exposure, including fine-tuning, model sparsification, and weight perturbation. Using EBYD, we conduct extensive experiments on 10 image attacks and 6 text attacks across 2 vision datasets (CIFAR-10 and an ImageNet subset) and 4 language datasets (SST-2, IMDB, Twitter, and AG's News). The results demonstrate the importance of backdoor exposure for backdoor defense, showing that the exposed models can significantly benefit a range of downstream defense tasks, including backdoor label detection, backdoor trigger recovery, backdoor model detection, and backdoor removal. We hope our work could inspire more research in developing advanced defense frameworks with exposed models. Our code is available at: https://github.com/bboylyg/Expose-Before-You-Defend.

**Authors**: Tianchun Wang, Yuanzhou Chen, Zichuan Liu, Zhanwen Chen, Haifeng Chen, Xiang Zhang, Wei Cheng

**Abstract**: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field of text generation, producing outputs that closely mimic human-like writing. Although academic and industrial institutions have developed detectors to prevent the malicious usage of LLM-generated texts, other research has doubt about the robustness of these systems. To stress test these detectors, we introduce a proxy-attack strategy that effortlessly compromises LLMs, causing them to produce outputs that align with human-written text and mislead detection systems. Our method attacks the source model by leveraging a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuned humanized small language model (SLM) in the decoding phase. Through an in-depth analysis, we demonstrate that our attack strategy is capable of generating responses that are indistinguishable to detectors, preventing them from differentiating between machine-generated and human-written text. We conduct systematic evaluations on extensive datasets using proxy-attacked open-source models, including Llama2-13B, Llama3-70B, and Mixtral-8*7B in both white- and black-box settings. Our findings show that the proxy-attack strategy effectively deceives the leading detectors, resulting in an average AUROC drop of 70.4% across multiple datasets, with a maximum drop of 90.3% on a single dataset. Furthermore, in cross-discipline scenarios, our strategy also bypasses these detectors, leading to a significant relative decrease of up to 90.9%, while in cross-language scenario, the drop reaches 91.3%. Despite our proxy-attack strategy successfully bypassing the detectors with such significant relative drops, we find that the generation quality of the attacked models remains preserved, even within a modest utility budget, when compared to the text produced by the original, unattacked source model.

**Abstract**: This paper identifies and analyzes applications in which Large Language Models (LLMs) can make Internet of Things (IoT) networks more intelligent and responsive through three case studies from critical topics: DDoS attack detection, macroprogramming over IoT systems, and sensor data processing. Our results reveal that the GPT model under few-shot learning achieves 87.6% detection accuracy, whereas the fine-tuned GPT increases the value to 94.9%. Given a macroprogramming framework, the GPT model is capable of writing scripts using high-level functions from the framework to handle possible incidents. Moreover, the GPT model shows efficacy in processing a vast amount of sensor data by offering fast and high-quality responses, which comprise expected results and summarized insights. Overall, the model demonstrates its potential to power a natural language interface. We hope that researchers will find these case studies inspiring to develop further.

**Authors**: Samuel Jacob Chacko, Sajib Biswas, Chashi Mahiul Islam, Fatema Tabassum Liza, Xiuwen Liu

**Abstract**: As powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) are now widely used for numerous practical applications, their safety is of critical importance. While alignment techniques have significantly improved overall safety, LLMs remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial inputs. Consequently, adversarial attack methods are extensively used to study and understand these vulnerabilities. However, current attack methods face significant limitations. Those relying on optimizing discrete tokens suffer from limited efficiency, while continuous optimization techniques fail to generate valid tokens from the model's vocabulary, rendering them impractical for real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for adversarial attacks that overcomes these limitations by leveraging regularized gradients with continuous optimization methods. Our approach is two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art greedy coordinate gradient-based method, significantly improving the attack success rate on aligned language models. Moreover, it generates valid tokens, addressing a fundamental limitation of existing continuous optimization methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack on five state-of-the-art LLMs using four datasets.

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) show inherent brittleness in their safety mechanisms, as evidenced by their susceptibility to jailbreaking and even non-malicious fine-tuning. This study explores this brittleness of safety alignment by leveraging pruning and low-rank modifications. We develop methods to identify critical regions that are vital for safety guardrails, and that are disentangled from utility-relevant regions at both the neuron and rank levels. Surprisingly, the isolated regions we find are sparse, comprising about $3\%$ at the parameter level and $2.5\%$ at the rank level. Removing these regions compromises safety without significantly impacting utility, corroborating the inherent brittleness of the model's safety mechanisms. Moreover, we show that LLMs remain vulnerable to low-cost fine-tuning attacks even when modifications to the safety-critical regions are restricted. These findings underscore the urgent need for more robust safety strategies in LLMs.

**Authors**: Ruisi Zhang, Farinaz Koushanfar

**Abstract**: The widely adopted and powerful generative large language models (LLMs) have raised concerns about intellectual property rights violations and the spread of machine-generated misinformation. Watermarking serves as a promising approch to establish ownership, prevent unauthorized use, and trace the origins of LLM-generated content. This paper summarizes and shares the challenges and opportunities we found when watermarking LLMs. We begin by introducing techniques for watermarking LLMs themselves under different threat models and scenarios. Next, we investigate watermarking methods designed for the content generated by LLMs, assessing their effectiveness and resilience against various attacks. We also highlight the importance of watermarking domain-specific models and data, such as those used in code generation, chip design, and medical applications. Furthermore, we explore methods like hardware acceleration to improve the efficiency of the watermarking process. Finally, we discuss the limitations of current approaches and outline future research directions for the responsible use and protection of these generative AI tools.

**Authors**: Miranda Christ, Sam Gunn, Tal Malkin, Mariana Raykova

**Abstract**: The recent explosion of high-quality language models has necessitated new methods for identifying AI-generated text. Watermarking is a leading solution and could prove to be an essential tool in the age of generative AI. Existing approaches embed watermarks at inference and crucially rely on the large language model (LLM) specification and parameters being secret, which makes them inapplicable to the open-source setting. In this work, we introduce the first watermarking scheme for open-source LLMs. Our scheme works by modifying the parameters of the model, but the watermark can be detected from just the outputs of the model. Perhaps surprisingly, we prove that our watermarks are unremovable under certain assumptions about the adversary's knowledge. To demonstrate the behavior of our construction under concrete parameter instantiations, we present experimental results with OPT-6.7B and OPT-1.3B. We demonstrate robustness to both token substitution and perturbation of the model parameters. We find that the stronger of these attacks, the model-perturbation attack, requires deteriorating the quality score to 0 out of 100 in order to bring the detection rate down to 50%.

**Authors**: Yulian Sun, Li Duan, Yong Li

**Abstract**: Privacy vulnerabilities in LLMs, such as leakage from memorization, have been constantly identified, and various mitigation proposals have been proposed. LoRA is usually used in fine-tuning LLMs and a good entry point to insert privacy-enhancing modules. In this ongoing research, we introduce PSY, a Posterior Sampling based PrivacY enhancer that can be used in LoRA. We propose a simple yet effective realization of PSY using posterior sampling, which effectively prevents privacy leakage from intermediate information and, in turn, preserves the privacy of data owners. We evaluate LoRA extended with PSY against state-of-the-art membership inference and data extraction attacks. The experiments are executed on three different LLM architectures fine-tuned on three datasets with LoRA. In contrast to the commonly used differential privacy method, we find that our proposed modification consistently reduces the attack success rate. Meanwhile, our method has almost no negative impact on model fine-tuning or final performance. Most importantly, PSY reveals a promising path toward privacy enhancement with latent space extensions.

**Authors**: Sudarshan Srinivasan, Maria Mahbub, Amir Sadovnik

**Abstract**: This position paper proposes a novel approach to advancing NLP security by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as engines for generating diverse adversarial attacks. Building upon recent work demonstrating LLMs' effectiveness in creating word-level adversarial examples, we argue for expanding this concept to encompass a broader range of attack types, including adversarial patches, universal perturbations, and targeted attacks. We posit that LLMs' sophisticated language understanding and generation capabilities can produce more effective, semantically coherent, and human-like adversarial examples across various domains and classifier architectures. This paradigm shift in adversarial NLP has far-reaching implications, potentially enhancing model robustness, uncovering new vulnerabilities, and driving innovation in defense mechanisms. By exploring this new frontier, we aim to contribute to the development of more secure, reliable, and trustworthy NLP systems for critical applications.

**Authors**: Samuele Poppi, Zheng-Xin Yong, Yifei He, Bobbie Chern, Han Zhao, Aobo Yang, Jianfeng Chi

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked widespread concerns about their safety. Recent work demonstrates that safety alignment of LLMs can be easily removed by fine-tuning with a few adversarially chosen instruction-following examples, i.e., fine-tuning attacks. We take a further step to understand fine-tuning attacks in multilingual LLMs. We first discover cross-lingual generalization of fine-tuning attacks: using a few adversarially chosen instruction-following examples in one language, multilingual LLMs can also be easily compromised (e.g., multilingual LLMs fail to refuse harmful prompts in other languages). Motivated by this finding, we hypothesize that safety-related information is language-agnostic and propose a new method termed Safety Information Localization (SIL) to identify the safety-related information in the model parameter space. Through SIL, we validate this hypothesis and find that only changing 20% of weight parameters in fine-tuning attacks can break safety alignment across all languages. Furthermore, we provide evidence to the alternative pathways hypothesis for why freezing safety-related parameters does not prevent fine-tuning attacks, and we demonstrate that our attack vector can still jailbreak LLMs adapted to new languages.



## **47. Safeguard is a Double-edged Sword: Denial-of-service Attack on Large Language Models**

**Authors**: Qingzhao Zhang, Ziyang Xiong, Z. Morley Mao

**Abstract**: Safety is a paramount concern of large language models (LLMs) in their open deployment. To this end, safeguard methods aim to enforce the ethical and responsible use of LLMs through safety alignment or guardrail mechanisms. However, we found that the malicious attackers could exploit false positives of safeguards, i.e., fooling the safeguard model to block safe content mistakenly, leading to a new denial-of-service (DoS) attack on LLMs. Specifically, by software or phishing attacks on user client software, attackers insert a short, seemingly innocuous adversarial prompt into to user prompt templates in configuration files; thus, this prompt appears in final user requests without visibility in the user interface and is not trivial to identify. By designing an optimization process that utilizes gradient and attention information, our attack can automatically generate seemingly safe adversarial prompts, approximately only 30 characters long, that universally block over 97\% of user requests on Llama Guard 3. The attack presents a new dimension of evaluating LLM safeguards focusing on false positives, fundamentally different from the classic jailbreak.



## **48. SCA: Highly Efficient Semantic-Consistent Unrestricted Adversarial Attack**

**Authors**: Zihao Pan, Weibin Wu, Yuhang Cao, Zibin Zheng

**Abstract**: Deep neural network based systems deployed in sensitive environments are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Unrestricted adversarial attacks typically manipulate the semantic content of an image (e.g., color or texture) to create adversarial examples that are both effective and photorealistic. Recent works have utilized the diffusion inversion process to map images into a latent space, where high-level semantics are manipulated by introducing perturbations. However, they often results in substantial semantic distortions in the denoised output and suffers from low efficiency. In this study, we propose a novel framework called Semantic-Consistent Unrestricted Adversarial Attacks (SCA), which employs an inversion method to extract edit-friendly noise maps and utilizes Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to provide semantic guidance throughout the process. Under the condition of rich semantic information provided by MLLM, we perform the DDPM denoising process of each step using a series of edit-friendly noise maps, and leverage DPM Solver++ to accelerate this process, enabling efficient sampling with semantic consistency. Compared to existing methods, our framework enables the efficient generation of adversarial examples that exhibit minimal discernible semantic changes. Consequently, we for the first time introduce Semantic-Consistent Adversarial Examples (SCAE). Extensive experiments and visualizations have demonstrated the high efficiency of SCA, particularly in being on average 12 times faster than the state-of-the-art attacks. Our research can further draw attention to the security of multimedia information.

**Authors**: He Cao, Weidi Luo, Yu Wang, Zijing Liu, Bing Feng, Yuan Yao, Yu Li

**Abstract**: With the extensive deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring their safety has become increasingly critical. However, existing defense methods often struggle with two key issues: (i) inadequate defense capabilities, particularly in domain-specific scenarios like chemistry, where a lack of specialized knowledge can lead to the generation of harmful responses to malicious queries. (ii) over-defensiveness, which compromises the general utility and responsiveness of LLMs. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a multi-agents-based defense framework, Guide for Defense (G4D), which leverages accurate external information to provide an unbiased summary of user intentions and analytically grounded safety response guidance. Extensive experiments on popular jailbreak attacks and benign datasets show that our G4D can enhance LLM's robustness against jailbreak attacks on general and domain-specific scenarios without compromising the model's general functionality.

**Authors**: Yihuan Mao, Yipeng Kang, Peilun Li, Ning Zhang, Wei Xu, Chongjie Zhang

**Abstract**: As large language model (LLM) agents increasingly integrate into our infrastructure, their robust coordination and message synchronization become vital. The Byzantine Generals Problem (BGP) is a critical model for constructing resilient multi-agent systems (MAS) under adversarial attacks. It describes a scenario where malicious agents with unknown identities exist in the system-situations that, in our context, could result from LLM agents' hallucinations or external attacks. In BGP, the objective of the entire system is to reach a consensus on the action to be taken. Traditional BGP requires global consensus among all agents; however, in practical scenarios, global consensus is not always necessary and can even be inefficient. Therefore, there is a pressing need to explore a refined version of BGP that aligns with the local coordination patterns observed in MAS. We refer to this refined version as Imperfect BGP (IBGP) in our research, aiming to address this discrepancy. To tackle this issue, we propose a framework that leverages consensus protocols within general MAS settings, providing provable resilience against communication attacks and adaptability to changing environments, as validated by empirical results. Additionally, we present a case study in a sensor network environment to illustrate the practical application of our protocol.
