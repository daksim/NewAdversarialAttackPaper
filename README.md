**SubmitDate**: 2023-11-20    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11995v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.11995v1)

**Authors**: Ali Abbasi, Parsa Nooralinejad, Hamed Pirsiavash, Soheil Kolouri

**Abstract**: Continual learning has gained substantial attention within the deep learning community, offering promising solutions to the challenging problem of sequential learning. Yet, a largely unexplored facet of this paradigm is its susceptibility to adversarial attacks, especially with the aim of inducing forgetting. In this paper, we introduce "BrainWash," a novel data poisoning method tailored to impose forgetting on a continual learner. By adding the BrainWash noise to a variety of baselines, we demonstrate how a trained continual learner can be induced to forget its previously learned tasks catastrophically, even when using these continual learning baselines. An important feature of our approach is that the attacker requires no access to previous tasks' data and is armed merely with the model's current parameters and the data belonging to the most recent task. Our extensive experiments highlight the efficacy of BrainWash, showcasing degradation in performance across various regularization-based continual learning methods.

Submitted to the IEEE for possible publication

**SubmitDate**: 2023-11-20    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11861v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.11861v1)

**Authors**: Zimu Wang, Wei Wang, Qi Chen, Qiufeng Wang, Anh Nguyen

**Abstract**: Deep learning-based natural language processing (NLP) models, particularly pre-trained language models (PLMs), have been revealed to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, the adversarial examples generated by many mainstream word-level adversarial attack models are neither valid nor natural, leading to the loss of semantic maintenance, grammaticality, and human imperceptibility. Based on the exceptional capacity of language understanding and generation of large language models (LLMs), we propose LLM-Attack, which aims at generating both valid and natural adversarial examples with LLMs. The method consists of two stages: word importance ranking (which searches for the most vulnerable words) and word synonym replacement (which substitutes them with their synonyms obtained from LLMs). Experimental results on the Movie Review (MR), IMDB, and Yelp Review Polarity datasets against the baseline adversarial attack models illustrate the effectiveness of LLM-Attack, and it outperforms the baselines in human and GPT-4 evaluation by a significant margin. The model can generate adversarial examples that are typically valid and natural, with the preservation of semantic meaning, grammaticality, and human imperceptibility.

**SubmitDate**: 2023-11-20    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11796v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.11796v1)

**Authors**: Guangjing Wang, Ce Zhou, Yuanda Wang, Bocheng Chen, Hanqing Guo, Qiben Yan

**Abstract**: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems such as autonomous vehicles, facial recognition, and speech recognition systems are increasingly integrated into our daily lives. However, despite their utility, these AI systems are vulnerable to a wide range of attacks such as adversarial, backdoor, data poisoning, membership inference, model inversion, and model stealing attacks. In particular, numerous attacks are designed to target a particular model or system, yet their effects can spread to additional targets, referred to as transferable attacks. Although considerable efforts have been directed toward developing transferable attacks, a holistic understanding of the advancements in transferable attacks remains elusive. In this paper, we comprehensively explore learning-based attacks from the perspective of transferability, particularly within the context of cyber-physical security. We delve into different domains -- the image, text, graph, audio, and video domains -- to highlight the ubiquitous and pervasive nature of transferable attacks. This paper categorizes and reviews the architecture of existing attacks from various viewpoints: data, process, model, and system. We further examine the implications of transferable attacks in practical scenarios such as autonomous driving, speech recognition, and large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we outline the potential research directions to encourage efforts in exploring the landscape of transferable attacks. This survey offers a holistic understanding of the prevailing transferable attacks and their impacts across different domains.

cs.CV

10 pages, 9 figures, Accepted to the International Joint Conference  on Biometrics (IJCB 2023)

**SubmitDate**: 2023-11-20    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11753v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.11753v1)

**Authors**: Sai Amrit Patnaik, Shivali Chansoriya, Anil K. Jain, Anoop M. Namboodiri

**Abstract**: Evaluating the risk level of adversarial images is essential for safely deploying face authentication models in the real world. Popular approaches for physical-world attacks, such as print or replay attacks, suffer from some limitations, like including physical and geometrical artifacts. Recently, adversarial attacks have gained attraction, which try to digitally deceive the learning strategy of a recognition system using slight modifications to the captured image. While most previous research assumes that the adversarial image could be digitally fed into the authentication systems, this is not always the case for systems deployed in the real world. This paper demonstrates the vulnerability of face authentication systems to adversarial images in physical world scenarios. We propose AdvGen, an automated Generative Adversarial Network, to simulate print and replay attacks and generate adversarial images that can fool state-of-the-art PADs in a physical domain attack setting. Using this attack strategy, the attack success rate goes up to 82.01%. We test AdvGen extensively on four datasets and ten state-of-the-art PADs. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack by conducting experiments in a realistic, physical environment.



## **5. Rethinking the Backward Propagation for Adversarial Transferability**

**SubmitDate**: 2023-11-20    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12685v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.12685v2)

**Authors**: Xiaosen Wang, Kangheng Tong, Kun He

**Abstract**: Transfer-based attacks generate adversarial examples on the surrogate model, which can mislead other black-box models without access, making it promising to attack real-world applications. Recently, several works have been proposed to boost adversarial transferability, in which the surrogate model is usually overlooked. In this work, we identify that non-linear layers (e.g., ReLU, max-pooling, etc.) truncate the gradient during backward propagation, making the gradient w.r.t. input image imprecise to the loss function. We hypothesize and empirically validate that such truncation undermines the transferability of adversarial examples. Based on these findings, we propose a novel method called Backward Propagation Attack (BPA) to increase the relevance between the gradient w.r.t. input image and loss function so as to generate adversarial examples with higher transferability. Specifically, BPA adopts a non-monotonic function as the derivative of ReLU and incorporates softmax with temperature to smooth the derivative of max-pooling, thereby mitigating the information loss during the backward propagation of gradients. Empirical results on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that not only does our method substantially boost the adversarial transferability, but it is also general to existing transfer-based attacks.

**Authors**: Evan Rose, Fnu Suya, David Evans

**Abstract**: Machine learning is susceptible to poisoning attacks, in which an attacker controls a small fraction of the training data and chooses that data with the goal of inducing some behavior unintended by the model developer in the trained model. We consider a realistic setting in which the adversary with the ability to insert a limited number of data points attempts to control the model's behavior on a specific subpopulation. Inspired by previous observations on disparate effectiveness of random label-flipping attacks on different subpopulations, we investigate the properties that can impact the effectiveness of state-of-the-art poisoning attacks against different subpopulations. For a family of 2-dimensional synthetic datasets, we empirically find that dataset separability plays a dominant role in subpopulation vulnerability for less separable datasets. However, well-separated datasets exhibit more dependence on individual subpopulation properties. We further discover that a crucial subpopulation property is captured by the difference in loss on the clean dataset between the clean model and a target model that misclassifies the subpopulation, and a subpopulation is much easier to attack if the loss difference is small. This property also generalizes to high-dimensional benchmark datasets. For the Adult benchmark dataset, we show that we can find semantically-meaningful subpopulation properties that are related to the susceptibilities of a selected group of subpopulations. The results in this paper are accompanied by a fully interactive web-based visualization of subpopulation poisoning attacks found at https://uvasrg.github.io/visualizing-poisoning



## **7. Assessing Prompt Injection Risks in 200+ Custom GPTs**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2023-11-20    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11538v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.11538v1)

**Authors**: Jiahao Yu, Yuhang Wu, Dong Shu, Mingyu Jin, Xinyu Xing

**Abstract**: In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, ChatGPT has been widely used in various applications. The new feature: customization of ChatGPT models by users to cater to specific needs has opened new frontiers in AI utility. However, this study reveals a significant security vulnerability inherent in these user-customized GPTs: prompt injection attacks. Through comprehensive testing of over 200 user-designed GPT models via adversarial prompts, we demonstrate that these systems are susceptible to prompt injections. Through prompt injection, an adversary can not only extract the customized system prompts but also access the uploaded files. This paper provides a first-hand analysis of the prompt injection, alongside the evaluation of the possible mitigation of such attacks. Our findings underscore the urgent need for robust security frameworks in the design and deployment of customizable GPT models. The intent of this paper is to raise awareness and prompt action in the AI community, ensuring that the benefits of GPT customization do not come at the cost of compromised security and privacy.



## **8. Token-Level Adversarial Prompt Detection Based on Perplexity Measures and Contextual Information**

cs.CL

**SubmitDate**: 2023-11-20    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11509v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.11509v1)

**Authors**: Zhengmian Hu, Gang Wu, Saayan Mitra, Ruiyi Zhang, Tong Sun, Heng Huang, Vishy Swaminathan

**Abstract**: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLM) have emerged as pivotal tools in various applications. However, these models are susceptible to adversarial prompt attacks, where attackers can carefully curate input strings that lead to undesirable outputs. The inherent vulnerability of LLMs stems from their input-output mechanisms, especially when presented with intensely out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. This paper proposes a token-level detection method to identify adversarial prompts, leveraging the LLM's capability to predict the next token's probability. We measure the degree of the model's perplexity and incorporate neighboring token information to encourage the detection of contiguous adversarial prompt sequences. As a result, we propose two methods: one that identifies each token as either being part of an adversarial prompt or not, and another that estimates the probability of each token being part of an adversarial prompt.



## **9. Interpretable Computer Vision Models through Adversarial Training: Unveiling the Robustness-Interpretability Connection**

cs.CV

**SubmitDate**: 2023-11-19    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02500v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.02500v2)

**Authors**: Delyan Boychev

**Abstract**: With the perpetual increase of complexity of the state-of-the-art deep neural networks, it becomes a more and more challenging task to maintain their interpretability. Our work aims to evaluate the effects of adversarial training utilized to produce robust models - less vulnerable to adversarial attacks. It has been shown to make computer vision models more interpretable. Interpretability is as essential as robustness when we deploy the models to the real world. To prove the correlation between these two problems, we extensively examine the models using local feature-importance methods (SHAP, Integrated Gradients) and feature visualization techniques (Representation Inversion, Class Specific Image Generation). Standard models, compared to robust are more susceptible to adversarial attacks, and their learned representations are less meaningful to humans. Conversely, these models focus on distinctive regions of the images which support their predictions. Moreover, the features learned by the robust model are closer to the real ones.



## **10. Revisiting and Advancing Adversarial Training Through A Simple Baseline**

**Authors**: Hong Liu

**Abstract**: In this paper, we delve into the essential components of adversarial training which is a pioneering defense technique against adversarial attacks. We indicate that some factors such as the loss function, learning rate scheduler, and data augmentation, which are independent of the model architecture, will influence adversarial robustness and generalization. When these factors are controlled for, we introduce a simple baseline approach, termed SimpleAT, that performs competitively with recent methods and mitigates robust overfitting. We conduct extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and Tiny-ImageNet, which validate the robustness of SimpleAT against state-of-the-art adversarial attackers such as AutoAttack. Our results also demonstrate that SimpleAT exhibits good performance in the presence of various image corruptions, such as those found in the CIFAR-10-C. In addition, we empirically show that SimpleAT is capable of reducing the variance in model predictions, which is considered the primary contributor to robust overfitting. Our results also reveal the connections between SimpleAT and many advanced state-of-the-art adversarial defense methods.



## **11. Robust Network Pruning With Sparse Entropic Wasserstein Regression**

submitted to ICLR 2024

**SubmitDate**: 2023-11-19    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04918v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04918v2)

**Authors**: Lei You, Hei Victor Cheng

**Abstract**: This study tackles the issue of neural network pruning that inaccurate gradients exist when computing the empirical Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). We introduce an entropic Wasserstein regression (EWR) formulation, capitalizing on the geometric attributes of the optimal transport (OT) problem. This is analytically showcased to excel in noise mitigation by adopting neighborhood interpolation across data points. The unique strength of the Wasserstein distance is its intrinsic ability to strike a balance between noise reduction and covariance information preservation. Extensive experiments performed on various networks show comparable performance of the proposed method with state-of-the-art (SoTA) network pruning algorithms. Our proposed method outperforms the SoTA when the network size or the target sparsity is large, the gain is even larger with the existence of noisy gradients, possibly from noisy data, analog memory, or adversarial attacks. Notably, our proposed method achieves a gain of 6% improvement in accuracy and 8% improvement in testing loss for MobileNetV1 with less than one-fourth of the network parameters remaining.



## **12. Adversarial Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models**

cs.CV

**SubmitDate**: 2023-11-19    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11261v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.11261v1)

**Authors**: Jiaming Zhang, Xingjun Ma, Xin Wang, Lingyu Qiu, Jiaqi Wang, Yu-Gang Jiang, Jitao Sang

**Abstract**: With the rapid advancement of multimodal learning, pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated remarkable capacities in bridging the gap between visual and language modalities. However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly in the image modality, presenting considerable security risks. This paper introduces Adversarial Prompt Tuning (AdvPT), a novel technique to enhance the adversarial robustness of image encoders in VLMs. AdvPT innovatively leverages learnable text prompts and aligns them with adversarial image embeddings, to address the vulnerabilities inherent in VLMs without the need for extensive parameter training or modification of the model architecture. We demonstrate that AdvPT improves resistance against white-box and black-box adversarial attacks and exhibits a synergistic effect when combined with existing image-processing-based defense techniques, further boosting defensive capabilities. Comprehensive experimental analyses provide insights into adversarial prompt tuning, a novel paradigm devoted to improving resistance to adversarial images through textual input modifications, paving the way for future robust multimodal learning research. These findings open up new possibilities for enhancing the security of VLMs. Our code will be available upon publication of the paper.

**SubmitDate**: 2023-11-19    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07127v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.07127v2)

**Authors**: Wenqi Fan, Shijie Wang, Xiao-yong Wei, Xiaowei Mei, Qing Li

**Abstract**: The rise of online social networks has facilitated the evolution of social recommender systems, which incorporate social relations to enhance users' decision-making process. With the great success of Graph Neural Networks in learning node representations, GNN-based social recommendations have been widely studied to model user-item interactions and user-user social relations simultaneously. Despite their great successes, recent studies have shown that these advanced recommender systems are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, in which attackers can inject well-designed fake user profiles to disrupt recommendation performances. While most existing studies mainly focus on targeted attacks to promote target items on vanilla recommender systems, untargeted attacks to degrade the overall prediction performance are less explored on social recommendations under a black-box scenario. To perform untargeted attacks on social recommender systems, attackers can construct malicious social relationships for fake users to enhance the attack performance. However, the coordination of social relations and item profiles is challenging for attacking black-box social recommendations. To address this limitation, we first conduct several preliminary studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of cross-community connections and cold-start items in degrading recommendations performance. Specifically, we propose a novel framework Multiattack based on multi-agent reinforcement learning to coordinate the generation of cold-start item profiles and cross-community social relations for conducting untargeted attacks on black-box social recommendations. Comprehensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attacking framework under the black-box setting.



## **14. Robust Network Slicing: Multi-Agent Policies, Adversarial Attacks, and Defensive Strategies**

Published in IEEE Transactions on Machine Learning in Communications  and Networking (TMLCN)

**SubmitDate**: 2023-11-19    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11206v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.11206v1)

**Authors**: Feng Wang, M. Cenk Gursoy, Senem Velipasalar

**Abstract**: In this paper, we present a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) framework for network slicing in a dynamic environment with multiple base stations and multiple users. In particular, we propose a novel deep RL framework with multiple actors and centralized critic (MACC) in which actors are implemented as pointer networks to fit the varying dimension of input. We evaluate the performance of the proposed deep RL algorithm via simulations to demonstrate its effectiveness. Subsequently, we develop a deep RL based jammer with limited prior information and limited power budget. The goal of the jammer is to minimize the transmission rates achieved with network slicing and thus degrade the network slicing agents' performance. We design a jammer with both listening and jamming phases and address jamming location optimization as well as jamming channel optimization via deep RL. We evaluate the jammer at the optimized location, generating interference attacks in the optimized set of channels by switching between the jamming phase and listening phase. We show that the proposed jammer can significantly reduce the victims' performance without direct feedback or prior knowledge on the network slicing policies. Finally, we devise a Nash-equilibrium-supervised policy ensemble mixed strategy profile for network slicing (as a defensive measure) and jamming. We evaluate the performance of the proposed policy ensemble algorithm by applying on the network slicing agents and the jammer agent in simulations to show its effectiveness.



## **15. Attention-Based Real-Time Defenses for Physical Adversarial Attacks in Vision Applications**

cs.CV

**SubmitDate**: 2023-11-19    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11191v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.11191v1)

**Authors**: Giulio Rossolini, Alessandro Biondi, Giorgio Buttazzo

**Abstract**: Deep neural networks exhibit excellent performance in computer vision tasks, but their vulnerability to real-world adversarial attacks, achieved through physical objects that can corrupt their predictions, raises serious security concerns for their application in safety-critical domains. Existing defense methods focus on single-frame analysis and are characterized by high computational costs that limit their applicability in multi-frame scenarios, where real-time decisions are crucial.   To address this problem, this paper proposes an efficient attention-based defense mechanism that exploits adversarial channel-attention to quickly identify and track malicious objects in shallow network layers and mask their adversarial effects in a multi-frame setting. This work advances the state of the art by enhancing existing over-activation techniques for real-world adversarial attacks to make them usable in real-time applications. It also introduces an efficient multi-frame defense framework, validating its efficacy through extensive experiments aimed at evaluating both defense performance and computational cost.



## **16. Improving Adversarial Transferability by Stable Diffusion**

cs.CV

**SubmitDate**: 2023-11-18    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11017v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.11017v1)

**Authors**: Jiayang Liu, Siyu Zhu, Siyuan Liang, Jie Zhang, Han Fang, Weiming Zhang, Ee-Chien Chang

**Abstract**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to adversarial examples, which introduce imperceptible perturbations to benign samples, deceiving DNN predictions. While some attack methods excel in the white-box setting, they often struggle in the black-box scenario, particularly against models fortified with defense mechanisms. Various techniques have emerged to enhance the transferability of adversarial attacks for the black-box scenario. Among these, input transformation-based attacks have demonstrated their effectiveness. In this paper, we explore the potential of leveraging data generated by Stable Diffusion to boost adversarial transferability. This approach draws inspiration from recent research that harnessed synthetic data generated by Stable Diffusion to enhance model generalization. In particular, previous work has highlighted the correlation between the presence of both real and synthetic data and improved model generalization. Building upon this insight, we introduce a novel attack method called Stable Diffusion Attack Method (SDAM), which incorporates samples generated by Stable Diffusion to augment input images. Furthermore, we propose a fast variant of SDAM to reduce computational overhead while preserving high adversarial transferability. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a substantial margin. Moreover, our approach is compatible with existing transfer-based attacks to further enhance adversarial transferability.



## **17. Security of quantum key distribution from generalised entropy accumulation**

quant-ph

30 pages

**SubmitDate**: 2023-11-18    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04993v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.04993v2)

**Authors**: Tony Metger, Renato Renner

**Abstract**: The goal of quantum key distribution (QKD) is to establish a secure key between two parties connected by an insecure quantum channel. To use a QKD protocol in practice, one has to prove that a finite size key is secure against general attacks: no matter the adversary's attack, they cannot gain useful information about the key. A much simpler task is to prove security against collective attacks, where the adversary is assumed to behave identically and independently in each round. In this work, we provide a formal framework for general QKD protocols and show that for any protocol that can be expressed in this framework, security against general attacks reduces to security against collective attacks, which in turn reduces to a numerical computation. Our proof relies on a recently developed information-theoretic tool called generalised entropy accumulation and can handle generic prepare-and-measure protocols directly without switching to an entanglement-based version.



## **18. PACOL: Poisoning Attacks Against Continual Learners**

cs.LG

**SubmitDate**: 2023-11-18    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10919v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.10919v1)

**Authors**: Huayu Li, Gregory Ditzler

**Abstract**: Continual learning algorithms are typically exposed to untrusted sources that contain training data inserted by adversaries and bad actors. An adversary can insert a small number of poisoned samples, such as mislabeled samples from previously learned tasks, or intentional adversarial perturbed samples, into the training datasets, which can drastically reduce the model's performance. In this work, we demonstrate that continual learning systems can be manipulated by malicious misinformation and present a new category of data poisoning attacks specific for continual learners, which we refer to as {\em Poisoning Attacks Against Continual Learners} (PACOL). The effectiveness of labeling flipping attacks inspires PACOL; however, PACOL produces attack samples that do not change the sample's label and produce an attack that causes catastrophic forgetting. A comprehensive set of experiments shows the vulnerability of commonly used generative replay and regularization-based continual learning approaches against attack methods. We evaluate the ability of label-flipping and a new adversarial poison attack, namely PACOL proposed in this work, to force the continual learning system to forget the knowledge of a learned task(s). More specifically, we compared the performance degradation of continual learning systems trained on benchmark data streams with and without poisoning attacks. Moreover, we discuss the stealthiness of the attacks in which we test the success rate of data sanitization defense and other outlier detection-based defenses for filtering out adversarial samples.



## **19. Parrot-Trained Adversarial Examples: Pushing the Practicality of Black-Box Audio Attacks against Speaker Recognition Models**

cs.SD

**SubmitDate**: 2023-11-17    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07780v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.07780v2)

**Authors**: Rui Duan, Zhe Qu, Leah Ding, Yao Liu, Zhuo Lu

**Abstract**: Audio adversarial examples (AEs) have posed significant security challenges to real-world speaker recognition systems. Most black-box attacks still require certain information from the speaker recognition model to be effective (e.g., keeping probing and requiring the knowledge of similarity scores). This work aims to push the practicality of the black-box attacks by minimizing the attacker's knowledge about a target speaker recognition model. Although it is not feasible for an attacker to succeed with completely zero knowledge, we assume that the attacker only knows a short (or a few seconds) speech sample of a target speaker. Without any probing to gain further knowledge about the target model, we propose a new mechanism, called parrot training, to generate AEs against the target model. Motivated by recent advancements in voice conversion (VC), we propose to use the one short sentence knowledge to generate more synthetic speech samples that sound like the target speaker, called parrot speech. Then, we use these parrot speech samples to train a parrot-trained(PT) surrogate model for the attacker. Under a joint transferability and perception framework, we investigate different ways to generate AEs on the PT model (called PT-AEs) to ensure the PT-AEs can be generated with high transferability to a black-box target model with good human perceptual quality. Real-world experiments show that the resultant PT-AEs achieve the attack success rates of 45.8% - 80.8% against the open-source models in the digital-line scenario and 47.9% - 58.3% against smart devices, including Apple HomePod (Siri), Amazon Echo, and Google Home, in the over-the-air scenario.



## **20. From Principle to Practice: Vertical Data Minimization for Machine Learning**

cs.LG

Accepted at IEEE S&P 2024

**SubmitDate**: 2023-11-17    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10500v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.10500v1)

**Authors**: Robin Staab, Nikola Jovanović, Mislav Balunović, Martin Vechev

**Abstract**: Aiming to train and deploy predictive models, organizations collect large amounts of detailed client data, risking the exposure of private information in the event of a breach. To mitigate this, policymakers increasingly demand compliance with the data minimization (DM) principle, restricting data collection to only that data which is relevant and necessary for the task. Despite regulatory pressure, the problem of deploying machine learning models that obey DM has so far received little attention. In this work, we address this challenge in a comprehensive manner. We propose a novel vertical DM (vDM) workflow based on data generalization, which by design ensures that no full-resolution client data is collected during training and deployment of models, benefiting client privacy by reducing the attack surface in case of a breach. We formalize and study the corresponding problem of finding generalizations that both maximize data utility and minimize empirical privacy risk, which we quantify by introducing a diverse set of policy-aligned adversarial scenarios. Finally, we propose a range of baseline vDM algorithms, as well as Privacy-aware Tree (PAT), an especially effective vDM algorithm that outperforms all baselines across several settings. We plan to release our code as a publicly available library, helping advance the standardization of DM for machine learning. Overall, we believe our work can help lay the foundation for further exploration and adoption of DM principles in real-world applications.



## **21. Breaking Boundaries: Balancing Performance and Robustness in Deep Wireless Traffic Forecasting**

cs.LG

Accepted for presentation at the ARTMAN workshop, part of the ACM  Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS), 2023

**SubmitDate**: 2023-11-17    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09790v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09790v2)

**Authors**: Romain Ilbert, Thai V. Hoang, Zonghua Zhang, Themis Palpanas

**Abstract**: Balancing the trade-off between accuracy and robustness is a long-standing challenge in time series forecasting. While most of existing robust algorithms have achieved certain suboptimal performance on clean data, sustaining the same performance level in the presence of data perturbations remains extremely hard. In this paper, we study a wide array of perturbation scenarios and propose novel defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks using real-world telecom data. We compare our strategy against two existing adversarial training algorithms under a range of maximal allowed perturbations, defined using $\ell_{\infty}$-norm, $\in [0.1,0.4]$. Our findings reveal that our hybrid strategy, which is composed of a classifier to detect adversarial examples, a denoiser to eliminate noise from the perturbed data samples, and a standard forecaster, achieves the best performance on both clean and perturbed data. Our optimal model can retain up to $92.02\%$ the performance of the original forecasting model in terms of Mean Squared Error (MSE) on clean data, while being more robust than the standard adversarially trained models on perturbed data. Its MSE is 2.71$\times$ and 2.51$\times$ lower than those of comparing methods on normal and perturbed data, respectively. In addition, the components of our models can be trained in parallel, resulting in better computational efficiency. Our results indicate that we can optimally balance the trade-off between the performance and robustness of forecasting models by improving the classifier and denoiser, even in the presence of sophisticated and destructive poisoning attacks.

**Abstract**: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) represent the most threatening form of attack nowadays since they can stay undetected for a long time. Adversary emulation is a proactive approach for preparing against these attacks. However, adversary emulation tools lack the anti-detection abilities of APTs. We introduce Laccolith, a hypervisor-based solution for adversary emulation with anti-detection to fill this gap. We also present an experimental study to compare Laccolith with MITRE CALDERA, a state-of-the-art solution for adversary emulation, against five popular anti-virus products. We found that CALDERA cannot evade detection, limiting the realism of emulated attacks, even when combined with a state-of-the-art anti-detection framework. Our experiments show that Laccolith can hide its activities from all the tested anti-virus products, thus making it suitable for realistic emulations.

**Authors**: Hee-Seon Kim, Minji Son, Minbeom Kim, Myung-Joon Kwon, Changick Kim

**Abstract**: As video analysis using deep learning models becomes more widespread, the vulnerability of such models to adversarial attacks is becoming a pressing concern. In particular, Universal Adversarial Perturbation (UAP) poses a significant threat, as a single perturbation can mislead deep learning models on entire datasets. We propose a novel video UAP using image data and image model. This enables us to take advantage of the rich image data and image model-based studies available for video applications. However, there is a challenge that image models are limited in their ability to analyze the temporal aspects of videos, which is crucial for a successful video attack. To address this challenge, we introduce the Breaking Temporal Consistency (BTC) method, which is the first attempt to incorporate temporal information into video attacks using image models. We aim to generate adversarial videos that have opposite patterns to the original. Specifically, BTC-UAP minimizes the feature similarity between neighboring frames in videos. Our approach is simple but effective at attacking unseen video models. Additionally, it is applicable to videos of varying lengths and invariant to temporal shifts. Our approach surpasses existing methods in terms of effectiveness on various datasets, including ImageNet, UCF-101, and Kinetics-400.

**Authors**: Fuyuki Kitagawa, Tomoyuki Morimae, Ryo Nishimaki, Takashi Yamakawa

**Abstract**: We construct quantum public-key encryption from one-way functions. In our construction, public keys are quantum, but ciphertexts are classical. Quantum public-key encryption from one-way functions (or weaker primitives such as pseudorandom function-like states) are also proposed in some recent works [Morimae-Yamakawa, eprint:2022/1336; Coladangelo, eprint:2023/282; Barooti-Grilo-Malavolta-Sattath-Vu-Walter, eprint:2023/877]. However, they have a huge drawback: they are secure only when quantum public keys can be transmitted to the sender (who runs the encryption algorithm) without being tampered with by the adversary, which seems to require unsatisfactory physical setup assumptions such as secure quantum channels. Our construction is free from such a drawback: it guarantees the secrecy of the encrypted messages even if we assume only unauthenticated quantum channels. Thus, the encryption is done with adversarially tampered quantum public keys. Our construction is the first quantum public-key encryption that achieves the goal of classical public-key encryption, namely, to establish secure communication over insecure channels, based only on one-way functions. Moreover, we show a generic compiler to upgrade security against chosen plaintext attacks (CPA security) into security against chosen ciphertext attacks (CCA security) only using one-way functions. As a result, we obtain CCA secure quantum public-key encryption based only on one-way functions.

**Authors**: Rafael Uetz, Marco Herzog, Louis Hackländer, Simon Schwarz, Martin Henze

**Abstract**: Cyberattacks have grown into a major risk for organizations, with common consequences being data theft, sabotage, and extortion. Since preventive measures do not suffice to repel attacks, timely detection of successful intruders is crucial to stop them from reaching their final goals. For this purpose, many organizations utilize Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems to centrally collect security-related events and scan them for attack indicators using expert-written detection rules. However, as we show by analyzing a set of widespread SIEM detection rules, adversaries can evade almost half of them easily, allowing them to perform common malicious actions within an enterprise network without being detected. To remedy these critical detection blind spots, we propose the idea of adaptive misuse detection, which utilizes machine learning to compare incoming events to SIEM rules on the one hand and known-benign events on the other hand to discover successful evasions. Based on this idea, we present AMIDES, an open-source proof-of-concept adaptive misuse detection system. Using four weeks of SIEM events from a large enterprise network and more than 500 hand-crafted evasions, we show that AMIDES successfully detects a majority of these evasions without any false alerts. In addition, AMIDES eases alert analysis by assessing which rules were evaded. Its computational efficiency qualifies AMIDES for real-world operation and hence enables organizations to significantly reduce detection blind spots with moderate effort.

**Authors**: Christoph Reich, Biplob Debnath, Deep Patel, Srimat Chakradhar

**Abstract**: JPEG remains one of the most widespread lossy image coding methods. However, the non-differentiable nature of JPEG restricts the application in deep learning pipelines. Several differentiable approximations of JPEG have recently been proposed to address this issue. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of existing diff. JPEG approaches and identifies critical details that have been missed by previous methods. To this end, we propose a novel diff. JPEG approach, overcoming previous limitations. Our approach is differentiable w.r.t. the input image, the JPEG quality, the quantization tables, and the color conversion parameters. We evaluate the forward and backward performance of our diff. JPEG approach against existing methods. Additionally, extensive ablations are performed to evaluate crucial design choices. Our proposed diff. JPEG resembles the (non-diff.) reference implementation best, significantly surpassing the recent-best diff. approach by $3.47$dB (PSNR) on average. For strong compression rates, we can even improve PSNR by $9.51$dB. Strong adversarial attack results are yielded by our diff. JPEG, demonstrating the effective gradient approximation. Our code is available at https://github.com/necla-ml/Diff-JPEG.

**Authors**: Kathrin Grosse, Lukas Bieringer, Tarek Richard Besold, Alexandre Alahi

**Abstract**: Recent works have identified a gap between research and practice in artificial intelligence security: threats studied in academia do not always reflect the practical use and security risks of AI. For example, while models are often studied in isolation, they form part of larger ML pipelines in practice. Recent works also brought forward that adversarial manipulations introduced by academic attacks are impractical. We take a first step towards describing the full extent of this disparity. To this end, we revisit the threat models of the six most studied attacks in AI security research and match them to AI usage in practice via a survey with \textbf{271} industrial practitioners. On the one hand, we find that all existing threat models are indeed applicable. On the other hand, there are significant mismatches: research is often too generous with the attacker, assuming access to information not frequently available in real-world settings. Our paper is thus a call for action to study more practical threat models in artificial intelligence security.



## **28. Hijacking Large Language Models via Adversarial In-Context Learning**

**SubmitDate**: 2023-11-16    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09948v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09948v1)

**Authors**: Yao Qiang, Xiangyu Zhou, Dongxiao Zhu

**Abstract**: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm leveraging LLMs for specific tasks by utilizing labeled examples as demonstrations in the precondition prompts. Despite its promising performance, ICL suffers from instability with the choice and arrangement of examples. Additionally, crafted adversarial attacks pose a notable threat to the robustness of ICL. However, existing attacks are either easy to detect, rely on external models, or lack specificity towards ICL. To address these issues, this work introduces a novel transferable attack for ICL, aiming to hijack LLMs to generate the targeted response. The proposed LLM hijacking attack leverages a gradient-based prompt search method to learn and append imperceptible adversarial suffixes to the in-context demonstrations. Extensive experimental results on various tasks and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our LLM hijacking attack, resulting in a distracted attention towards adversarial tokens, consequently leading to the targeted unwanted outputs.

**Authors**: Riccardo Grazzi, Massimiliano Pontil, Saverio Salzo

**Abstract**: We analyse a general class of bilevel problems, in which the upper-level problem consists in the minimization of a smooth objective function and the lower-level problem is to find the fixed point of a smooth contraction map. This type of problems include instances of meta-learning, equilibrium models, hyperparameter optimization and data poisoning adversarial attacks. Several recent works have proposed algorithms which warm-start the lower-level problem, i.e.~they use the previous lower-level approximate solution as a staring point for the lower-level solver. This warm-start procedure allows one to improve the sample complexity in both the stochastic and deterministic settings, achieving in some cases the order-wise optimal sample complexity. However, there are situations, e.g., meta learning and equilibrium models, in which the warm-start procedure is not well-suited or ineffective. In this work we show that without warm-start, it is still possible to achieve order-wise (near) optimal sample complexity. In particular, we propose a simple method which uses (stochastic) fixed point iterations at the lower-level and projected inexact gradient descent at the upper-level, that reaches an $\epsilon$-stationary point using $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ and $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ samples for the stochastic and the deterministic setting, respectively. Finally, compared to methods using warm-start, our approach yields a simpler analysis that does not need to study the coupled interactions between the upper-level and lower-level iterates.



## **30. On the Exploitability of Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback for Large Language Models**

**Authors**: Jiongxiao Wang, Junlin Wu, Muhao Chen, Yevgeniy Vorobeychik, Chaowei Xiao

**Abstract**: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is a methodology designed to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, playing an important role in LLMs alignment. Despite its advantages, RLHF relies on human annotators to rank the text, which can introduce potential security vulnerabilities if any adversarial annotator (i.e., attackers) manipulates the ranking score by up-ranking any malicious text to steer the LLM adversarially. To assess the red-teaming of RLHF against human preference data poisoning, we propose RankPoison, a poisoning attack method on candidates' selection of preference rank flipping to reach certain malicious behaviors (e.g., generating longer sequences, which can increase the computational cost). With poisoned dataset generated by RankPoison, we can perform poisoning attacks on LLMs to generate longer tokens without hurting the original safety alignment performance. Moreover, applying RankPoison, we also successfully implement a backdoor attack where LLMs can generate longer answers under questions with the trigger word. Our findings highlight critical security challenges in RLHF, underscoring the necessity for more robust alignment methods for LLMs.

**Authors**: Tadeu Freitas, Mário Neto, Inês Dutra, João Soares, Manuel Correia, Rolando Martins

**Abstract**: Intrusion Tolerant Systems (ITSs) are a necessary component for cyber-services/infrastructures. Additionally, as cyberattacks follow a multi-domain attack surface, a similar defensive approach should be applied, namely, the use of an evolving multi-disciplinary solution that combines ITS, cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence (AI). With the increased popularity of AI solutions, due to Big Data use-case scenarios and decision support and automation scenarios, new opportunities to apply Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have emerged, namely ITS empowerment. Using ML algorithms, an ITS can augment its intrusion tolerance capability, by learning from previous attacks and from known vulnerabilities. As such, this work's contribution is twofold: (1) an ITS architecture (Skynet) based on the state-of-the-art and incorporates new components to increase its intrusion tolerance capability and its adaptability to new adversaries; (2) an improved Risk Manager design that leverages AI to improve ITSs by automatically assessing OS risks to intrusions, and advise with safer configurations. One of the reasons that intrusions are successful is due to bad configurations or slow adaptability to new threats. This can be caused by the dependency that systems have for human intervention. One of the characteristics in Skynet and HAL 9000 design is the removal of human intervention. Being fully automatized lowers the chance of successful intrusions caused by human error. Our experiments using Skynet, shows that HAL is able to choose 15% safer configurations than the state-of-the-art risk manager.

**Authors**: Lingbo Mo, Boshi Wang, Muhao Chen, Huan Sun

**Abstract**: The rapid progress in open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) is significantly driving AI development forward. However, there is still a limited understanding of their trustworthiness. Deploying these models at scale without sufficient trustworthiness can pose significant risks, highlighting the need to uncover these issues promptly. In this work, we conduct an assessment of open-source LLMs on trustworthiness, scrutinizing them across eight different aspects including toxicity, stereotypes, ethics, hallucination, fairness, sycophancy, privacy, and robustness against adversarial demonstrations. We propose an enhanced Chain of Utterances-based (CoU) prompting strategy by incorporating meticulously crafted malicious demonstrations for trustworthiness attack. Our extensive experiments encompass recent and representative series of open-source LLMs, including Vicuna, MPT, Falcon, Mistral, and Llama 2. The empirical outcomes underscore the efficacy of our attack strategy across diverse aspects. More interestingly, our result analysis reveals that models with superior performance in general NLP tasks do not always have greater trustworthiness; in fact, larger models can be more vulnerable to attacks. Additionally, models that have undergone instruction tuning, focusing on instruction following, tend to be more susceptible, although fine-tuning LLMs for safety alignment proves effective in mitigating adversarial trustworthiness attacks.

**Authors**: Yueqing Liang, Lu Cheng, Ali Payani, Kai Shu

**Abstract**: This work investigates the potential of undermining both fairness and detection performance in abusive language detection. In a dynamic and complex digital world, it is crucial to investigate the vulnerabilities of these detection models to adversarial fairness attacks to improve their fairness robustness. We propose a simple yet effective framework FABLE that leverages backdoor attacks as they allow targeted control over the fairness and detection performance. FABLE explores three types of trigger designs (i.e., rare, artificial, and natural triggers) and novel sampling strategies. Specifically, the adversary can inject triggers into samples in the minority group with the favored outcome (i.e., ``non-abusive'') and flip their labels to the unfavored outcome, i.e., ``abusive''. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FABLE attacking fairness and utility in abusive language detection.

**Authors**: Zhen Xiang, Zidi Xiong, Bo Li

**Abstract**: Backdoor (Trojan) attack is a common threat to deep neural networks, where samples from one or more source classes embedded with a backdoor trigger will be misclassified to adversarial target classes. Existing methods for detecting whether a classifier is backdoor attacked are mostly designed for attacks with a single adversarial target (e.g., all-to-one attack). To the best of our knowledge, without supervision, no existing methods can effectively address the more general X2X attack with an arbitrary number of source classes, each paired with an arbitrary target class. In this paper, we propose UMD, the first Unsupervised Model Detection method that effectively detects X2X backdoor attacks via a joint inference of the adversarial (source, target) class pairs. In particular, we first define a novel transferability statistic to measure and select a subset of putative backdoor class pairs based on a proposed clustering approach. Then, these selected class pairs are jointly assessed based on an aggregation of their reverse-engineered trigger size for detection inference, using a robust and unsupervised anomaly detector we proposed. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and Imagenette dataset, and show that our unsupervised UMD outperforms SOTA detectors (even with supervision) by 17%, 4%, and 8%, respectively, in terms of the detection accuracy against diverse X2X attacks. We also show the strong detection performance of UMD against several strong adaptive attacks.

**Authors**: Anvith Thudi, Hengrui Jia, Casey Meehan, Ilia Shumailov, Nicolas Papernot

**Abstract**: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is the canonical approach to private deep learning. While the current privacy analysis of DP-SGD is known to be tight in some settings, several empirical results suggest that models trained on common benchmark datasets leak significantly less privacy for many datapoints. Yet, despite past attempts, a rigorous explanation for why this is the case has not been reached. Is it because there exist tighter privacy upper bounds when restricted to these dataset settings, or are our attacks not strong enough for certain datapoints? In this paper, we provide the first per-instance (i.e., ``data-dependent") DP analysis of DP-SGD. Our analysis captures the intuition that points with similar neighbors in the dataset enjoy better data-dependent privacy than outliers. Formally, this is done by modifying the per-step privacy analysis of DP-SGD to introduce a dependence on the distribution of model updates computed from a training dataset. We further develop a new composition theorem to effectively use this new per-step analysis to reason about an entire training run. Put all together, our evaluation shows that this novel DP-SGD analysis allows us to now formally show that DP-SGD leaks significantly less privacy for many datapoints (when trained on common benchmarks) than the current data-independent guarantee. This implies privacy attacks will necessarily fail against many datapoints if the adversary does not have sufficient control over the possible training datasets.

**Abstract**: We introduce and study the problem of adversarial arithmetic, which provides a simple yet challenging testbed for language model alignment. This problem is comprised of arithmetic questions posed in natural language, with an arbitrary adversarial string inserted before the question is complete. Even in the simple setting of 1-digit addition problems, it is easy to find adversarial prompts that make all tested models (including PaLM2, GPT4, Claude2) misbehave, and even to steer models to a particular wrong answer. We additionally provide a simple algorithm for finding successful attacks by querying those same models, which we name "prompt inversion rejection sampling" (PIRS). We finally show that models can be partially hardened against these attacks via reinforcement learning and via agentic constitutional loops. However, we were not able to make a language model fully robust against adversarial arithmetic attacks.

**Authors**: Yuanwei Wu, Xiang Li, Yixin Liu, Pan Zhou, Lichao Sun

**Abstract**: Existing work on jailbreak Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has focused primarily on adversarial examples in model inputs, with less attention to vulnerabilities in model APIs. To fill the research gap, we carry out the following work: 1) We discover a system prompt leakage vulnerability in GPT-4V. Through carefully designed dialogue, we successfully steal the internal system prompts of GPT-4V. This finding indicates potential exploitable security risks in MLLMs; 2)Based on the acquired system prompts, we propose a novel MLLM jailbreaking attack method termed SASP (Self-Adversarial Attack via System Prompt). By employing GPT-4 as a red teaming tool against itself, we aim to search for potential jailbreak prompts leveraging stolen system prompts. Furthermore, in pursuit of better performance, we also add human modification based on GPT-4's analysis, which further improves the attack success rate to 98.7\%; 3) We evaluated the effect of modifying system prompts to defend against jailbreaking attacks. Results show that appropriately designed system prompts can significantly reduce jailbreak success rates. Overall, our work provides new insights into enhancing MLLM security, demonstrating the important role of system prompts in jailbreaking, which could be leveraged to greatly facilitate jailbreak success rates while also holding the potential for defending against jailbreaks.

**Authors**: A K Nirala, A Joshi, C Hegde, S Sarkar

**Abstract**: A key benefit of deep vision-language models such as CLIP is that they enable zero-shot open vocabulary classification; the user has the ability to define novel class labels via natural language prompts at inference time. However, while CLIP-based zero-shot classifiers have demonstrated competitive performance across a range of domain shifts, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Therefore, ensuring the robustness of such models is crucial for their reliable deployment in the wild.   In this work, we introduce Open Vocabulary Certification (OVC), a fast certification method designed for open-vocabulary models like CLIP via randomized smoothing techniques. Given a base "training" set of prompts and their corresponding certified CLIP classifiers, OVC relies on the observation that a classifier with a novel prompt can be viewed as a perturbed version of nearby classifiers in the base training set. Therefore, OVC can rapidly certify the novel classifier using a variation of incremental randomized smoothing. By using a caching trick, we achieve approximately two orders of magnitude acceleration in the certification process for novel prompts. To achieve further (heuristic) speedups, OVC approximates the embedding space at a given input using a multivariate normal distribution bypassing the need for sampling via forward passes through the vision backbone. We demonstrate the effectiveness of OVC on through experimental evaluation using multiple vision-language backbones on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet test datasets.

**Abstract**: In recent years, Reward Machines (RMs) have stood out as a simple yet effective automata-based formalism for exposing and exploiting task structure in reinforcement learning settings.

With my thesis, I aim to provide the first analysis of the security of RM-based reinforcement learning techniques, with the hope of motivating further research in the field, and I propose and evaluate a novel class of attacks on RM-based techniques: blinding attacks.

**Authors**: Yatong Bai, Brendon G. Anderson, Aerin Kim, Somayeh Sojoudi

**Abstract**: While prior research has proposed a plethora of methods that build neural classifiers robust against adversarial robustness, practitioners are still reluctant to adopt them due to their unacceptably severe clean accuracy penalties. This paper significantly alleviates this accuracy-robustness trade-off by mixing the output probabilities of a standard classifier and a robust classifier, where the standard network is optimized for clean accuracy and is not robust in general. We show that the robust base classifier's confidence difference for correct and incorrect examples is the key to this improvement. In addition to providing intuitions and empirical evidence, we theoretically certify the robustness of the mixed classifier under realistic assumptions. Furthermore, we adapt an adversarial input detector into a mixing network that adaptively adjusts the mixture of the two base models, further reducing the accuracy penalty of achieving robustness. The proposed flexible method, termed "adaptive smoothing", can work in conjunction with existing or even future methods that improve clean accuracy, robustness, or adversary detection. Our empirical evaluation considers strong attack methods, including AutoAttack and adaptive attack. On the CIFAR-100 dataset, our method achieves an 85.21% clean accuracy while maintaining a 38.72% $\ell_\infty$-AutoAttacked ($\epsilon = 8/255$) accuracy, becoming the second most robust method on the RobustBench CIFAR-100 benchmark as of submission, while improving the clean accuracy by ten percentage points compared with all listed models. The code that implements our method is available at https://github.com/Bai-YT/AdaptiveSmoothing.

**Authors**: Illia Horenko

**Abstract**: Simply-verifiable mathematical conditions for existence, uniqueness and explicit analytical computation of minimal adversarial paths (MAP) and minimal adversarial distances (MAD) for (locally) uniquely-invertible classifiers, for generalized linear models (GLM), and for entropic AI (EAI) are formulated and proven. Practical computation of MAP and MAD, their comparison and interpretations for various classes of AI tools (for neuronal networks, boosted random forests, GLM and EAI) are demonstrated on the common synthetic benchmarks: on a double Swiss roll spiral and its extensions, as well as on the two biomedical data problems (for the health insurance claim predictions, and for the heart attack lethality classification). On biomedical applications it is demonstrated how MAP provides unique minimal patient-specific risk-mitigating interventions in the predefined subsets of accessible control variables.

**Authors**: Yibo Wang, Xiangjue Dong, James Caverlee, Philip S. Yu

**Abstract**: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) that achieve success in applications are susceptible to adversarial attack methods that are capable of generating adversarial examples with minor perturbations. Although recent attack methods can achieve a relatively high attack success rate (ASR), our observation shows that the generated adversarial examples have a different data distribution compared with the original examples. Specifically, these adversarial examples exhibit lower confidence levels and higher distance to the training data distribution. As a result, they are easy to detect using very simple detection methods, diminishing the actual effectiveness of these attack methods. To solve this problem, we propose a Distribution-Aware LoRA-based Adversarial Attack (DALA) method, which considers the distribution shift of adversarial examples to improve attack effectiveness under detection methods. We further design a new evaluation metric NASR combining ASR and detection for the attack task. We conduct experiments on four widely-used datasets and validate the attack effectiveness on ASR and NASR of the adversarial examples generated by DALA on the BERT-base model and the black-box LLaMA2-7b model.

**Abstract**: Neural networks build the foundation of several intelligent systems, which, however, are known to be easily fooled by adversarial examples. Recent advances made these attacks possible even in air-gapped scenarios, where the autonomous system observes its surroundings by, e.g., a camera. We extend these ideas in our research and evaluate the robustness of multi-camera setups against such physical adversarial examples. This scenario becomes ever more important with the rise in popularity of autonomous vehicles, which fuse the information of several cameras for their driving decision. While we find that multi-camera setups provide some robustness towards past attack methods, we see that this advantage reduces when optimizing on multiple perspectives at once. We propose a novel attack method that we call Transcender-MC, where we incorporate online 3D renderings and perspective projections in the training process. Moreover, we motivate that certain data augmentation techniques can facilitate the generation of successful adversarial examples even further. Transcender-MC is 11% more effective in successfully attacking multi-camera setups than state-of-the-art methods. Our findings offer valuable insights regarding the resilience of object detection in a setup with multiple cameras and motivate the need of developing adequate defense mechanisms against them.

**Authors**: Zi Yin, Wei Ding, Jia Liu

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are central to a multitude of applications but struggle with significant risks, notably in generating harmful content and biases. Drawing an analogy to the human psyche's conflict between evolutionary survival instincts and societal norm adherence elucidated in Freud's psychoanalysis theory, we argue that LLMs suffer a similar fundamental conflict, arising between their inherent desire for syntactic and semantic continuity, established during the pre-training phase, and the post-training alignment with human values. This conflict renders LLMs vulnerable to adversarial attacks, wherein intensifying the models' desire for continuity can circumvent alignment efforts, resulting in the generation of harmful information. Through a series of experiments, we first validated the existence of the desire for continuity in LLMs, and further devised a straightforward yet powerful technique, such as incomplete sentences, negative priming, and cognitive dissonance scenarios, to demonstrate that even advanced LLMs struggle to prevent the generation of harmful information. In summary, our study uncovers the root of LLMs' vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, hereby questioning the efficacy of solely relying on sophisticated alignment methods, and further advocates for a new training idea that integrates modal concepts alongside traditional amodal concepts, aiming to endow LLMs with a more nuanced understanding of real-world contexts and ethical considerations.



## **45. The Perception-Robustness Tradeoff in Deterministic Image Restoration**

**Authors**: Guy Ohayon, Tomer Michaeli, Michael Elad

**Abstract**: We study the behavior of deterministic methods for solving inverse problems in imaging. These methods are commonly designed to achieve two goals: (1) attaining high perceptual quality, and (2) generating reconstructions that are consistent with the measurements. We provide a rigorous proof that the better a predictor satisfies these two requirements, the larger its Lipschitz constant must be, regardless of the nature of the degradation involved. In particular, to approach perfect perceptual quality and perfect consistency, the Lipschitz constant of the model must grow to infinity. This implies that such methods are necessarily more susceptible to adversarial attacks. We demonstrate our theory on single image super-resolution algorithms, addressing both noisy and noiseless settings. We also show how this undesired behavior can be leveraged to explore the posterior distribution, thereby allowing the deterministic model to imitate stochastic methods.

**Authors**: Shanghao Shi, Ning Wang, Yang Xiao, Chaoyu Zhang, Yi Shi, Y. Thomas Hou, Wenjing Lou

**Abstract**: Federated learning is known for its capability to safeguard participants' data privacy. However, recently emerged model inversion attacks (MIAs) have shown that a malicious parameter server can reconstruct individual users' local data samples through model updates. The state-of-the-art attacks either rely on computation-intensive search-based optimization processes to recover each input batch, making scaling difficult, or they involve the malicious parameter server adding extra modules before the global model architecture, rendering the attacks too conspicuous and easily detectable.   To overcome these limitations, we propose Scale-MIA, a novel MIA capable of efficiently and accurately recovering training samples of clients from the aggregated updates, even when the system is under the protection of a robust secure aggregation protocol. Unlike existing approaches treating models as black boxes, Scale-MIA recognizes the importance of the intricate architecture and inner workings of machine learning models. It identifies the latent space as the critical layer for breaching privacy and decomposes the complex recovery task into an innovative two-step process to reduce computation complexity. The first step involves reconstructing the latent space representations (LSRs) from the aggregated model updates using a closed-form inversion mechanism, leveraging specially crafted adversarial linear layers. In the second step, the whole input batches are recovered from the LSRs by feeding them into a fine-tuned generative decoder.   We implemented Scale-MIA on multiple commonly used machine learning models and conducted comprehensive experiments across various settings. The results demonstrate that Scale-MIA achieves excellent recovery performance on different datasets, exhibiting high reconstruction rates, accuracy, and attack efficiency on a larger scale compared to state-of-the-art MIAs.



## **47. A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing: Generalized Nested Jailbreak Prompts can Fool Large Language Models Easily**

**Authors**: Peng Ding, Jun Kuang, Dan Ma, Xuezhi Cao, Yunsen Xian, Jiajun Chen, Shujian Huang

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, are designed to provide useful and safe responses. However, adversarial prompts known as 'jailbreaks' can circumvent safeguards, leading LLMs to generate harmful content. Exploring jailbreak prompts can help to better reveal the weaknesses of LLMs and further steer us to secure them. Unfortunately, existing jailbreak methods either suffer from intricate manual design or require optimization on another white-box model, compromising generalization or jailbreak efficiency. In this paper, we generalize jailbreak prompt attacks into two aspects: (1) Prompt Rewriting and (2) Scenario Nesting. Based on this, we propose ReNeLLM, an automatic framework that leverages LLMs themselves to generate effective jailbreak prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReNeLLM significantly improves the attack success rate while greatly reducing the time cost compared to existing baselines. Our study also reveals the inadequacy of current defense methods in safeguarding LLMs. Finally, we offer detailed analysis and discussion from the perspective of prompt execution priority on the failure of LLMs' defense. We hope that our research can catalyze both the academic community and LLMs vendors towards the provision of safer and more regulated Large Language Models.



## **48. On The Relationship Between Universal Adversarial Attacks And Sparse Representations**

**Authors**: Dana Weitzner, Raja Giryes

**Abstract**: The prominent success of neural networks, mainly in computer vision tasks, is increasingly shadowed by their sensitivity to small, barely perceivable adversarial perturbations in image input.   In this work, we aim at explaining this vulnerability through the framework of sparsity.   We show the connection between adversarial attacks and sparse representations, with a focus on explaining the universality and transferability of adversarial examples in neural networks.   To this end, we show that sparse coding algorithms, and the neural network-based learned iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (LISTA) among them, suffer from this sensitivity, and that common attacks on neural networks can be expressed as attacks on the sparse representation of the input image. The phenomenon that we observe holds true also when the network is agnostic to the sparse representation and dictionary, and thus can provide a possible explanation for the universality and transferability of adversarial attacks.   The code is available at https://github.com/danawr/adversarial_attacks_and_sparse_representations.

**Abstract**: As Federated Learning (FL) grows in popularity, new decentralized frameworks are becoming widespread. These frameworks leverage the benefits of decentralized environments to enable fast and energy-efficient inter-device communication. However, this growing popularity also intensifies the need for robust security measures. While existing research has explored various aspects of FL security, the role of adversarial node placement in decentralized networks remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by analyzing the performance of decentralized FL for various adversarial placement strategies when adversaries can jointly coordinate their placement within a network. We establish two baseline strategies for placing adversarial node: random placement and network centrality-based placement. Building on this foundation, we propose a novel attack algorithm that prioritizes adversarial spread over adversarial centrality by maximizing the average network distance between adversaries. We show that the new attack algorithm significantly impacts key performance metrics such as testing accuracy, outperforming the baseline frameworks by between 9% and 66.5% for the considered setups. Our findings provide valuable insights into the vulnerabilities of decentralized FL systems, setting the stage for future research aimed at developing more secure and robust decentralized FL frameworks.



## **50. Towards Improving Robustness Against Common Corruptions in Object Detectors Using Adversarial Contrastive Learning**

**SubmitDate**: 2023-11-14    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07928v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.07928v1)

**Authors**: Shashank Kotyan, Danilo Vasconcellos Vargas

**Abstract**: Neural networks have revolutionized various domains, exhibiting remarkable accuracy in tasks like natural language processing and computer vision. However, their vulnerability to slight alterations in input samples poses challenges, particularly in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. Current approaches, such as introducing distortions during training, fall short in addressing unforeseen corruptions. This paper proposes an innovative adversarial contrastive learning framework to enhance neural network robustness simultaneously against adversarial attacks and common corruptions. By generating instance-wise adversarial examples and optimizing contrastive loss, our method fosters representations that resist adversarial perturbations and remain robust in real-world scenarios. Subsequent contrastive learning then strengthens the similarity between clean samples and their adversarial counterparts, fostering representations resistant to both adversarial attacks and common distortions. By focusing on improving performance under adversarial and real-world conditions, our approach aims to bolster the robustness of neural networks in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous vehicles navigating unpredictable weather conditions. We anticipate that this framework will contribute to advancing the reliability of neural networks in challenging environments, facilitating their widespread adoption in mission-critical scenarios.
