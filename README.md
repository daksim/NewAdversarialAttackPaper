## **1. GAN-based Medical Image Small Region Forgery Detection via a Two-Stage Cascade Framework**

eess.IV

**SubmitDate**: 2022-05-30    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.15170v1)

**Authors**: Jianyi Zhang, Xuanxi Huang, Yaqi Liu, Yuyang Han, Zixiao Xiang

**Abstracts**: Using generative adversarial network (GAN)\cite{RN90} for data enhancement of medical images is significantly helpful for many computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tasks. A new attack called CT-GAN has emerged. It can inject or remove lung cancer lesions to CT scans. Because the tampering region may even account for less than 1\% of the original image, even state-of-the-art methods are challenging to detect the traces of such tampering.   This paper proposes a cascade framework to detect GAN-based medical image small region forgery like CT-GAN. In the local detection stage, we train the detector network with small sub-images so that interference information in authentic regions will not affect the detector. We use depthwise separable convolution and residual to prevent the detector from over-fitting and enhance the ability to find forged regions through the attention mechanism. The detection results of all sub-images in the same image will be combined into a heatmap. In the global classification stage, using gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) can better extract features of the heatmap. Because the shape and size of the tampered area are uncertain, we train PCA and SVM methods for classification. Our method can classify whether a CT image has been tampered and locate the tampered position. Sufficient experiments show that our method can achieve excellent performance.

**SubmitDate**: 2022-05-30    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.15130v1)

**Authors**: Xu Cheng, Hao Zhang, Yue Xin, Wen Shen, Jie Ren, Quanshi Zhang

**Abstracts**: This paper mathematically derives an analytic solution of the adversarial perturbation on a ReLU network, and theoretically explains the difficulty of adversarial training. Specifically, we formulate the dynamics of the adversarial perturbation generated by the multi-step attack, which shows that the adversarial perturbation tends to strengthen eigenvectors corresponding to a few top-ranked eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix of the loss w.r.t. the input. We also prove that adversarial training tends to strengthen the influence of unconfident input samples with large gradient norms in an exponential manner. Besides, we find that adversarial training strengthens the influence of the Hessian matrix of the loss w.r.t. network parameters, which makes the adversarial training more likely to oscillate along directions of a few samples, and boosts the difficulty of adversarial training. Crucially, our proofs provide a unified explanation for previous findings in understanding adversarial training.

**SubmitDate**: 2022-05-30    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.15128v1)

**Authors**: Hamid Bostani, Zhuoran Liu, Zhengyu Zhao, Veelasha Moonsamy

**Abstracts**: Strengthening the robustness of machine learning-based malware detectors against realistic evasion attacks remains one of the major obstacles for Android malware detection. To that end, existing work has focused on interpreting domain constraints of Android malware in the problem space, where problem-space realizable adversarial examples are generated. In this paper, we provide another promising way to achieve the same goal but based on interpreting the domain constraints in the feature space, where feature-space realizable adversarial examples are generated. Specifically, we present a novel approach to extracting feature-space domain constraints by learning meaningful feature dependencies from data, and applying them based on a novel robust feature space. Experimental results successfully demonstrate the effectiveness of our novel robust feature space in providing adversarial robustness for DREBIN, a state-of-the-art Android malware detector. For example, it can decrease the evasion rate of a realistic gradient-based attack by $96.4\%$ in a limited-knowledge (transfer) setting and by $13.8\%$ in a more challenging, perfect-knowledge setting. In addition, we show that directly using our learned domain constraints in the adversarial retraining framework leads to about $84\%$ improvement in a limited-knowledge setting, with up to $377\times$ faster implementation than using problem-space adversarial examples.

cs.CV

**SubmitDate**: 2022-05-30    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14969v1)

**Authors**: Jinyi Wang, Zhaoyang Lyu, Dahua Lin, Bo Dai, Hongfei Fu

**Abstracts**: With wider application of deep neural networks (DNNs) in various algorithms and frameworks, security threats have become one of the concerns. Adversarial attacks disturb DNN-based image classifiers, in which attackers can intentionally add imperceptible adversarial perturbations on input images to fool the classifiers. In this paper, we propose a novel purification approach, referred to as guided diffusion model for purification (GDMP), to help protect classifiers from adversarial attacks. The core of our approach is to embed purification into the diffusion denoising process of a Denoised Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), so that its diffusion process could submerge the adversarial perturbations with gradually added Gaussian noises, and both of these noises can be simultaneously removed following a guided denoising process. On our comprehensive experiments across various datasets, the proposed GDMP is shown to reduce the perturbations raised by adversarial attacks to a shallow range, thereby significantly improving the correctness of classification. GDMP improves the robust accuracy by 5%, obtaining 90.1% under PGD attack on the CIFAR10 dataset. Moreover, GDMP achieves 70.94% robustness on the challenging ImageNet dataset.



## **5. CalFAT: Calibrated Federated Adversarial Training with Label Skewness**

cs.LG

**SubmitDate**: 2022-05-30    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14926v1)

**Authors**: Chen Chen, Yuchen Liu, Xingjun Ma, Lingjuan Lyu

**Abstracts**: Recent studies have shown that, like traditional machine learning, federated learning (FL) is also vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To improve the adversarial robustness of FL, few federated adversarial training (FAT) methods have been proposed to apply adversarial training locally before global aggregation. Although these methods demonstrate promising results on independent identically distributed (IID) data, they suffer from training instability issues on non-IID data with label skewness, resulting in much degraded natural accuracy. This tends to hinder the application of FAT in real-world applications where the label distribution across the clients is often skewed. In this paper, we study the problem of FAT under label skewness, and firstly reveal one root cause of the training instability and natural accuracy degradation issues: skewed labels lead to non-identical class probabilities and heterogeneous local models. We then propose a Calibrated FAT (CalFAT) approach to tackle the instability issue by calibrating the logits adaptively to balance the classes. We show both theoretically and empirically that the optimization of CalFAT leads to homogeneous local models across the clients and much improved convergence rate and final performance.



## **6. CausalAdv: Adversarial Robustness through the Lens of Causality**

cs.LG

ICLR2022, 20 pages, 3 figures

**SubmitDate**: 2022-05-30    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06196v2)

**Authors**: Yonggang Zhang, Mingming Gong, Tongliang Liu, Gang Niu, Xinmei Tian, Bo Han, Bernhard Schölkopf, Kun Zhang

**Abstracts**: The adversarial vulnerability of deep neural networks has attracted significant attention in machine learning. As causal reasoning has an instinct for modelling distribution change, it is essential to incorporate causality into analyzing this specific type of distribution change induced by adversarial attacks. However, causal formulations of the intuition of adversarial attacks and the development of robust DNNs are still lacking in the literature. To bridge this gap, we construct a causal graph to model the generation process of adversarial examples and define the adversarial distribution to formalize the intuition of adversarial attacks. From the causal perspective, we study the distinction between the natural and adversarial distribution and conclude that the origin of adversarial vulnerability is the focus of models on spurious correlations. Inspired by the causal understanding, we propose the Causal inspired Adversarial distribution alignment method, CausalAdv, to eliminate the difference between natural and adversarial distributions by considering spurious correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. Our work is the first attempt towards using causality to understand and mitigate the adversarial vulnerability.



## **7. Exposing Fine-grained Adversarial Vulnerability of Face Anti-spoofing Models**

cs.CV

**SubmitDate**: 2022-05-30    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14851v1)

**Authors**: Songlin Yang, Wei Wang, Chenye Xu, Bo Peng, Jing Dong

**Abstracts**: Adversarial attacks seriously threaten the high accuracy of face anti-spoofing models. Little adversarial noise can perturb their classification of live and spoofing. The existing adversarial attacks fail to figure out which part of the target face anti-spoofing model is vulnerable, making adversarial analysis tricky. So we propose fine-grained attacks for exposing adversarial vulnerability of face anti-spoofing models. Firstly, we propose Semantic Feature Augmentation (SFA) module, which makes adversarial noise semantic-aware to live and spoofing features. SFA considers the contrastive classes of data and texture bias of models in the context of face anti-spoofing, increasing the attack success rate by nearly 40% on average. Secondly, we generate fine-grained adversarial examples based on SFA and the multitask network with auxiliary information. We evaluate three annotations (facial attributes, spoofing types and illumination) and two geometric maps (depth and reflection), on four backbone networks (VGG, Resnet, Densenet and Swin Transformer). We find that facial attributes annotation and state-of-art networks fail to guarantee that models are robust to adversarial attacks. Such adversarial attacks can be generalized to more auxiliary information and backbone networks, to help our community handle the trade-off between accuracy and adversarial robustness.



## **8. Efficient Reward Poisoning Attacks on Online Deep Reinforcement Learning**

cs.LG

**SubmitDate**: 2022-05-30    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14842v1)

**Authors**: Yinglun Xu, Qi Zeng, Gagandeep Singh

**Abstracts**: We study data poisoning attacks on online deep reinforcement learning (DRL) where the attacker is oblivious to the learning algorithm used by the agent and does not necessarily have full knowledge of the environment. We demonstrate the intrinsic vulnerability of state-of-the-art DRL algorithms by designing a general reward poisoning framework called adversarial MDP attacks. We instantiate our framework to construct several new attacks which only corrupt the rewards for a small fraction of the total training timesteps and make the agent learn a low-performing policy. Our key insight is that the state-of-the-art DRL algorithms strategically explore the environment to find a high-performing policy. Our attacks leverage this insight to construct a corrupted environment for misleading the agent towards learning low-performing policies with a limited attack budget. We provide a theoretical analysis of the efficiency of our attack and perform an extensive evaluation. Our results show that our attacks efficiently poison agents learning with a variety of state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, such as DQN, PPO, SAC, etc. under several popular classical control and MuJoCo environments.



## **9. Unfooling Perturbation-Based Post Hoc Explainers**

cs.AI

10 pages (not including references and supplemental)

**SubmitDate**: 2022-05-29    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14772v1)

**Authors**: Zachariah Carmichael, Walter J Scheirer

**Abstracts**: Monumental advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have lured the interest of doctors, lenders, judges, and other professionals. While these high-stakes decision-makers are optimistic about the technology, those familiar with AI systems are wary about the lack of transparency of its decision-making processes. Perturbation-based post hoc explainers offer a model agnostic means of interpreting these systems while only requiring query-level access. However, recent work demonstrates that these explainers can be fooled adversarially. This discovery has adverse implications for auditors, regulators, and other sentinels. With this in mind, several natural questions arise - how can we audit these black box systems? And how can we ascertain that the auditee is complying with the audit in good faith? In this work, we rigorously formalize this problem and devise a defense against adversarial attacks on perturbation-based explainers. We propose algorithms for the detection (CAD-Detect) and defense (CAD-Defend) of these attacks, which are aided by our novel conditional anomaly detection approach, KNN-CAD. We demonstrate that our approach successfully detects whether a black box system adversarially conceals its decision-making process and mitigates the adversarial attack on real-world data for the prevalent explainers, LIME and SHAP.



## **10. On the Robustness of Safe Reinforcement Learning under Observational Perturbations**

cs.LG

27 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables

**SubmitDate**: 2022-05-29    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14691v1)

**Authors**: Zuxin Liu, Zijian Guo, Zhepeng Cen, Huan Zhang, Jie Tan, Bo Li, Ding Zhao

**Abstracts**: Safe reinforcement learning (RL) trains a policy to maximize the task reward while satisfying safety constraints. While prior works focus on the performance optimality, we find that the optimal solutions of many safe RL problems are not robust and safe against carefully designed observational perturbations. We formally analyze the unique properties of designing effective state adversarial attackers in the safe RL setting. We show that baseline adversarial attack techniques for standard RL tasks are not always effective for safe RL and proposed two new approaches - one maximizes the cost and the other maximizes the reward. One interesting and counter-intuitive finding is that the maximum reward attack is strong, as it can both induce unsafe behaviors and make the attack stealthy by maintaining the reward. We further propose a more effective adversarial training framework for safe RL and evaluate it via comprehensive experiments. This work sheds light on the inherited connection between observational robustness and safety in RL and provides a pioneer work for future safe RL studies.



## **11. Superclass Adversarial Attack**

cs.CV

**SubmitDate**: 2022-05-29    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14629v1)

**Authors**: Soichiro Kumano, Hiroshi Kera, Toshihiko Yamasaki

**Abstracts**: Adversarial attacks have only focused on changing the predictions of the classifier, but their danger greatly depends on how the class is mistaken. For example, when an automatic driving system mistakes a Persian cat for a Siamese cat, it is hardly a problem. However, if it mistakes a cat for a 120km/h minimum speed sign, serious problems can arise. As a stepping stone to more threatening adversarial attacks, we consider the superclass adversarial attack, which causes misclassification of not only fine classes, but also superclasses. We conducted the first comprehensive analysis of superclass adversarial attacks (an existing and 19 new methods) in terms of accuracy, speed, and stability, and identified several strategies to achieve better performance. Although this study is aimed at superclass misclassification, the findings can be applied to other problem settings involving multiple classes, such as top-k and multi-label classification attacks.



## **12. Graph Structure Based Data Augmentation Method**

cs.LG

**SubmitDate**: 2022-05-29    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14619v1)

**Authors**: Kyung Geun Kim, Byeong Tak Lee

**Abstracts**: In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based data augmentation method that can generally be applied to medical waveform data with graph structures. In the process of recording medical waveform data, such as electrocardiogram (ECG) or electroencephalogram (EEG), angular perturbations between the measurement leads exist due to discrepancies in lead positions. The data samples with large angular perturbations often cause inaccuracy in algorithmic prediction tasks. We design a graph-based data augmentation technique that exploits the inherent graph structures within the medical waveform data to improve both performance and robustness. In addition, we show that the performance gain from graph augmentation results from robustness by testing against adversarial attacks. Since the bases of performance gain are orthogonal, the graph augmentation can be used in conjunction with existing data augmentation techniques to further improve the final performance. We believe that our graph augmentation method opens up new possibilities to explore in data augmentation.



## **13. Problem-Space Evasion Attacks in the Android OS: a Survey**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2022-05-29    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14576v1)

**Authors**: Harel Berger, Dr. Chen Hajaj, Dr. Amit Dvir

**Abstracts**: Android is the most popular OS worldwide. Therefore, it is a target for various kinds of malware. As a countermeasure, the security community works day and night to develop appropriate Android malware detection systems, with ML-based or DL-based systems considered as some of the most common types. Against these detection systems, intelligent adversaries develop a wide set of evasion attacks, in which an attacker slightly modifies a malware sample to evade its target detection system. In this survey, we address problem-space evasion attacks in the Android OS, where attackers manipulate actual APKs, rather than their extracted feature vector. We aim to explore this kind of attacks, frequently overlooked by the research community due to a lack of knowledge of the Android domain, or due to focusing on general mathematical evasion attacks - i.e., feature-space evasion attacks. We discuss the different aspects of problem-space evasion attacks, using a new taxonomy, which focuses on key ingredients of each problem-space attack, such as the attacker model, the attacker's mode of operation, and the functional assessment of post-attack applications.



## **14. BadDet: Backdoor Attacks on Object Detection**

cs.CV

**SubmitDate**: 2022-05-28    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14497v1)

**Authors**: Shih-Han Chan, Yinpeng Dong, Jun Zhu, Xiaolu Zhang, Jun Zhou

**Abstracts**: Deep learning models have been deployed in numerous real-world applications such as autonomous driving and surveillance. However, these models are vulnerable in adversarial environments. Backdoor attack is emerging as a severe security threat which injects a backdoor trigger into a small portion of training data such that the trained model behaves normally on benign inputs but gives incorrect predictions when the specific trigger appears. While most research in backdoor attacks focuses on image classification, backdoor attacks on object detection have not been explored but are of equal importance. Object detection has been adopted as an important module in various security-sensitive applications such as autonomous driving. Therefore, backdoor attacks on object detection could pose severe threats to human lives and properties. We propose four kinds of backdoor attacks for object detection task: 1) Object Generation Attack: a trigger can falsely generate an object of the target class; 2) Regional Misclassification Attack: a trigger can change the prediction of a surrounding object to the target class; 3) Global Misclassification Attack: a single trigger can change the predictions of all objects in an image to the target class; and 4) Object Disappearance Attack: a trigger can make the detector fail to detect the object of the target class. We develop appropriate metrics to evaluate the four backdoor attacks on object detection. We perform experiments using two typical object detection models -- Faster-RCNN and YOLOv3 on different datasets. More crucially, we demonstrate that even fine-tuning on another benign dataset cannot remove the backdoor hidden in the object detection model. To defend against these backdoor attacks, we propose Detector Cleanse, an entropy-based run-time detection framework to identify poisoned testing samples for any deployed object detector.



## **15. Policy Smoothing for Provably Robust Reinforcement Learning**

cs.LG

Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022

**SubmitDate**: 2022-05-28    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.11420v3)

**Authors**: Aounon Kumar, Alexander Levine, Soheil Feizi

**Abstracts**: The study of provable adversarial robustness for deep neural networks (DNNs) has mainly focused on static supervised learning tasks such as image classification. However, DNNs have been used extensively in real-world adaptive tasks such as reinforcement learning (RL), making such systems vulnerable to adversarial attacks as well. Prior works in provable robustness in RL seek to certify the behaviour of the victim policy at every time-step against a non-adaptive adversary using methods developed for the static setting. But in the real world, an RL adversary can infer the defense strategy used by the victim agent by observing the states, actions, etc., from previous time-steps and adapt itself to produce stronger attacks in future steps. We present an efficient procedure, designed specifically to defend against an adaptive RL adversary, that can directly certify the total reward without requiring the policy to be robust at each time-step. Our main theoretical contribution is to prove an adaptive version of the Neyman-Pearson Lemma -- a key lemma for smoothing-based certificates -- where the adversarial perturbation at a particular time can be a stochastic function of current and previous observations and states as well as previous actions. Building on this result, we propose policy smoothing where the agent adds a Gaussian noise to its observation at each time-step before passing it through the policy function. Our robustness certificates guarantee that the final total reward obtained by policy smoothing remains above a certain threshold, even though the actions at intermediate time-steps may change under the attack. Our experiments on various environments like Cartpole, Pong, Freeway and Mountain Car show that our method can yield meaningful robustness guarantees in practice.



## **16. Certifying Model Accuracy under Distribution Shifts**

cs.LG

**SubmitDate**: 2022-05-28    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12440v2)

**Authors**: Aounon Kumar, Alexander Levine, Tom Goldstein, Soheil Feizi

**Abstracts**: Certified robustness in machine learning has primarily focused on adversarial perturbations of the input with a fixed attack budget for each point in the data distribution. In this work, we present provable robustness guarantees on the accuracy of a model under bounded Wasserstein shifts of the data distribution. We show that a simple procedure that randomizes the input of the model within a transformation space is provably robust to distributional shifts under the transformation. Our framework allows the datum-specific perturbation size to vary across different points in the input distribution and is general enough to include fixed-sized perturbations as well. Our certificates produce guaranteed lower bounds on the performance of the model for any (natural or adversarial) shift of the input distribution within a Wasserstein ball around the original distribution. We apply our technique to: (i) certify robustness against natural (non-adversarial) transformations of images such as color shifts, hue shifts and changes in brightness and saturation, (ii) certify robustness against adversarial shifts of the input distribution, and (iii) show provable lower bounds (hardness results) on the performance of models trained on so-called "unlearnable" datasets that have been poisoned to interfere with model training.



## **17. SHORTSTACK: Distributed, Fault-tolerant, Oblivious Data Access**

cs.CR

Full version of USENIX OSDI'22 paper

**SubmitDate**: 2022-05-28    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14281v1)

**Authors**: Midhul Vuppalapati, Kushal Babel, Anurag Khandelwal, Rachit Agarwal

**Abstracts**: Many applications that benefit from data offload to cloud services operate on private data. A now-long line of work has shown that, even when data is offloaded in an encrypted form, an adversary can learn sensitive information by analyzing data access patterns. Existing techniques for oblivious data access--that protect against access pattern attacks--require a centralized, stateful and trusted, proxy to orchestrate data accesses from applications to cloud services. We show that, in failure-prone deployments, such a centralized and stateful proxy results in violation of oblivious data access security guarantees and/or system unavailability. Thus, we initiate the study of distributed, fault-tolerant, oblivious data access.   We present SHORTSTACK, a distributed proxy architecture for oblivious data access in failure-prone deployments. SHORTSTACK achieves the classical obliviousness guarantee--access patterns observed by the adversary being independent of the input--even under a powerful passive persistent adversary that can force failure of arbitrary (bounded-sized) subset of proxy servers at arbitrary times. We also introduce a security model that enables studying oblivious data access with distributed, failure-prone, servers. We provide a formal proof that SHORTSTACK enables oblivious data access under this model, and show empirically that SHORTSTACK performance scales near-linearly with number of distributed proxy servers.



## **18. Semi-supervised Semantics-guided Adversarial Training for Trajectory Prediction**

cs.LG

11 pages, adversarial training for trajectory prediction

**SubmitDate**: 2022-05-27    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14230v1)

**Authors**: Ruochen Jiao, Xiangguo Liu, Takami Sato, Qi Alfred Chen, Qi Zhu

**Abstracts**: Predicting the trajectories of surrounding objects is a critical task in self-driving and many other autonomous systems. Recent works demonstrate that adversarial attacks on trajectory prediction, where small crafted perturbations are introduced to history trajectories, may significantly mislead the prediction of future trajectories and ultimately induce unsafe planning. However, few works have addressed enhancing the robustness of this important safety-critical task. In this paper, we present the first adversarial training method for trajectory prediction. Compared with typical adversarial training on image tasks, our work is challenged by more random inputs with rich context, and a lack of class labels. To address these challenges, we propose a method based on a semi-supervised adversarial autoencoder that models disentangled semantic features with domain knowledge and provides additional latent labels for the adversarial training. Extensive experiments with different types of attacks demonstrate that our semi-supervised semantics-guided adversarial training method can effectively mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks and generally improve the system's adversarial robustness to a variety of attacks, including unseen ones. We believe that such semantics-guided architecture and advancement in robust generalization is an important step for developing robust prediction models and enabling safe decision making.



## **19. A Single-Adversary-Single-Detector Zero-Sum Game in Networked Control Systems**

math.OC

6 pages, 6 figures, 1 table, accepted to the 9th IFAC Conference on  Networked Systems, Zurich, July 2022

**SubmitDate**: 2022-05-27    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14001v1)

**Authors**: Anh Tung Nguyen, André M. H. Teixeira, Alexander Medvedev

**Abstracts**: This paper proposes a game-theoretic approach to address the problem of optimal sensor placement for detecting cyber-attacks in networked control systems. The problem is formulated as a zero-sum game with two players, namely a malicious adversary and a detector. Given a protected target vertex, the detector places a sensor at a single vertex to monitor the system and detect the presence of the adversary. On the other hand, the adversary selects a single vertex through which to conduct a cyber-attack that maximally disrupts the target vertex while remaining undetected by the detector. As our first contribution, for a given pair of attack and monitor vertices and a known target vertex, the game payoff function is defined as the output-to-output gain of the respective system. Then, the paper characterizes the set of feasible actions by the detector that ensures bounded values of the game payoff. Finally, an algebraic sufficient condition is proposed to examine whether a given vertex belongs to the set of feasible monitor vertices. The optimal sensor placement is then determined by computing the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium of the zero-sum game through linear programming. The approach is illustrated via a numerical example of a 10-vertex networked control system with a given target vertex.



## **20. Standalone Neural ODEs with Sensitivity Analysis**

cs.LG

25 pages, 15 figures

**SubmitDate**: 2022-05-27    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.13933v1)

**Authors**: Rym Jaroudi, Lukáš Malý, Gabriel Eilertsen, Tomas B. Johansson, Jonas Unger, George Baravdish

**Abstracts**: This paper presents the Standalone Neural ODE (sNODE), a continuous-depth neural ODE model capable of describing a full deep neural network. This uses a novel nonlinear conjugate gradient (NCG) descent optimization scheme for training, where the Sobolev gradient can be incorporated to improve smoothness of model weights. We also present a general formulation of the neural sensitivity problem and show how it is used in the NCG training. The sensitivity analysis provides a reliable measure of uncertainty propagation throughout a network, and can be used to study model robustness and to generate adversarial attacks. Our evaluations demonstrate that our novel formulations lead to increased robustness and performance as compared to ResNet models, and that it opens up for new opportunities for designing and developing machine learning with improved explainability.



## **21. Evaluating the Robustness of Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous and Adversarial Policies in a Multi-agent Urban Driving Environment**

cs.AI

**SubmitDate**: 2022-05-27    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11947v2)

**Authors**: Aizaz Sharif, Dusica Marijan

**Abstracts**: Deep reinforcement learning is actively used for training autonomous and adversarial car policies in a simulated driving environment. Due to the large availability of various reinforcement learning algorithms and the lack of their systematic comparison across different driving scenarios, we are unsure of which ones are more effective for training and testing autonomous car software in single-agent as well as multi-agent driving environments. A benchmarking framework for the comparison of deep reinforcement learning in a vision-based autonomous driving will open up the possibilities for training better autonomous car driving policies. Furthermore, autonomous cars trained on deep reinforcement learning-based algorithms are known for being vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To guard against adversarial attacks, we can train autonomous cars on adversarial driving policies. However, we lack the knowledge of which deep reinforcement learning algorithms would act as good adversarial agents able to effectively test autonomous cars. To address these challenges, we provide an open and reusable benchmarking framework for systematic evaluation and comparative analysis of deep reinforcement learning algorithms for autonomous and adversarial driving in a single- and multi-agent environment. Using the framework, we perform a comparative study of five discrete and two continuous action space deep reinforcement learning algorithms. We run the experiments in a vision-only high fidelity urban driving simulated environments. The results indicate that only some of the deep reinforcement learning algorithms perform consistently better across single and multi-agent scenarios when trained in a multi-agent-only setting.



## **22. Adversarial Deep Reinforcement Learning for Improving the Robustness of Multi-agent Autonomous Driving Policies**

cs.AI

**SubmitDate**: 2022-05-27    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11937v2)

**Authors**: Aizaz Sharif, Dusica Marijan

**Abstracts**: Autonomous cars are well known for being vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can compromise the safety of the car and pose danger to other road users. To effectively defend against adversaries, it is required to not only test autonomous cars for finding driving errors, but to improve the robustness of the cars to these errors. To this end, in this paper, we propose a two-step methodology for autonomous cars that consists of (i) finding failure states in autonomous cars by training the adversarial driving agent, and (ii) improving the robustness of autonomous cars by retraining them with effective adversarial inputs. Our methodology supports testing ACs in a multi-agent environment, where we train and compare adversarial car policy on two custom reward functions to test the driving control decision of autonomous cars. We run experiments in a vision-based high fidelity urban driving simulated environment. Our results show that adversarial testing can be used for finding erroneous autonomous driving behavior, followed by adversarial training for improving the robustness of deep reinforcement learning based autonomous driving policies. We demonstrate that the autonomous cars retrained using the effective adversarial inputs noticeably increase the performance of their driving policies in terms of reduced collision and offroad steering errors.



## **23. fakeWeather: Adversarial Attacks for Deep Neural Networks Emulating Weather Conditions on the Camera Lens of Autonomous Systems**

cs.LG

To appear at the 2022 International Joint Conference on Neural  Networks (IJCNN), at the 2022 IEEE World Congress on Computational  Intelligence (WCCI), July 2022, Padua, Italy

**SubmitDate**: 2022-05-27    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.13807v1)

**Authors**: Alberto Marchisio, Giovanni Caramia, Maurizio Martina, Muhammad Shafique

**Abstracts**: Recently, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable performances in many applications, while several studies have enhanced their vulnerabilities to malicious attacks. In this paper, we emulate the effects of natural weather conditions to introduce plausible perturbations that mislead the DNNs. By observing the effects of such atmospheric perturbations on the camera lenses, we model the patterns to create different masks that fake the effects of rain, snow, and hail. Even though the perturbations introduced by our attacks are visible, their presence remains unnoticed due to their association with natural events, which can be especially catastrophic for fully-autonomous and unmanned vehicles. We test our proposed fakeWeather attacks on multiple Convolutional Neural Network and Capsule Network models, and report noticeable accuracy drops in the presence of such adversarial perturbations. Our work introduces a new security threat for DNNs, which is especially severe for safety-critical applications and autonomous systems.

**Abstracts**: State-of-the-art face recognition (FR) approaches have shown remarkable results in predicting whether two faces belong to the same identity, yielding accuracies between 92% and 100% depending on the difficulty of the protocol. However, the accuracy drops substantially when exposed to morphed faces, specifically generated to look similar to two identities. To generate morphed faces, we integrate a simple pretrained FR model into a generative adversarial network (GAN) and modify several loss functions for face morphing. In contrast to previous works, our approach and analyses are not limited to pairs of frontal faces with the same ethnicity and gender. Our qualitative and quantitative results affirm that our approach achieves a seamless change between two faces even in unconstrained scenarios. Despite using features from a simpler FR model for face morphing, we demonstrate that even recent FR systems struggle to distinguish the morphed face from both identities obtaining an accuracy of only 55-70%. Besides, we provide further insights into how knowing the FR system makes it particularly vulnerable to face morphing attacks.

**Abstracts**: Speaker recognition has become very popular in many application scenarios, such as smart homes and smart assistants, due to ease of use for remote control and economic-friendly features. The rapid development of SRSs is inseparable from the advancement of machine learning, especially neural networks. However, previous work has shown that machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks in the image domain, which inspired researchers to explore adversarial attacks and defenses in Speaker Recognition Systems (SRS). Unfortunately, existing literature lacks a thorough review of this topic. In this paper, we fill this gap by performing a comprehensive survey on adversarial attacks and defenses in SRSs. We first introduce the basics of SRSs and concepts related to adversarial attacks. Then, we propose two sets of criteria to evaluate the performance of attack methods and defense methods in SRSs, respectively. After that, we provide taxonomies of existing attack methods and defense methods, and further review them by employing our proposed criteria. Finally, based on our review, we find some open issues and further specify a number of future directions to motivate the research of SRSs security.

**Authors**: Ali Shirali

**Abstracts**: Datasets are often generated in a sequential manner, where the previous samples and intermediate decisions or interventions affect subsequent samples. This is especially prominent in cases where there are significant human-AI interactions, such as in recommender systems. To characterize the importance of this relationship across samples, we propose to use adversarial attacks on popular evaluation processes. We present sequence-aware boosting attacks and provide a lower bound on the amount of extra information that can be exploited from a confidential test set solely based on the order of the observed data. We use real and synthetic data to test our methods and show that the evaluation process on the MovieLense-100k dataset can be affected by $\sim1\%$ which is important when considering the close competition. Codes are publicly available.

**Abstracts**: Member inference (MI) attacks aim to determine if a specific data sample was used to train a machine learning model. Thus, MI is a major privacy threat to models trained on private sensitive data, such as medical records. In MI attacks one may consider the black-box settings, where the model's parameters and activations are hidden from the adversary, or the white-box case where they are available to the attacker. In this work, we focus on the latter and present a novel MI attack for it that employs influence functions, or more specifically the samples' self-influence scores, to perform the MI prediction. We evaluate our attack on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet datasets, using versatile architectures such as AlexNet, ResNet, and DenseNet. Our attack method achieves new state-of-the-art results for both training with and without data augmentations. Code is available at https://github.com/giladcohen/sif_mi_attack.

**Abstracts**: Cryptocurrency systems can be subject to deanonimization attacks by exploiting the network-level communication on their peer-to-peer network. Adversaries who control a set of colluding node(s) within the peer-to-peer network can observe transactions being exchanged and infer the parties involved. Thus, various network anonymity schemes have been proposed to mitigate this problem, with some solutions providing theoretical anonymity guarantees.   In this work, we model such peer-to-peer network anonymity solutions and evaluate their anonymity guarantees. To do so, we propose a novel framework that uses Bayesian inference to obtain the probability distributions linking transactions to their possible originators. We characterize transaction anonymity with those distributions, using entropy as metric of adversarial uncertainty on the originator's identity. In particular, we model Dandelion, Dandelion++ and Lightning Network. We study different configurations and demonstrate that none of them offers acceptable anonymity to their users. For instance, our analysis reveals that in the widely deployed Lightning Network, with 1% strategically chosen colluding nodes the adversary can uniquely determine the originator for about 50% of the total transactions in the network. In Dandelion, an adversary that controls 15% of the nodes has on average uncertainty among only 8 possible originators. Moreover, we observe that due to the way Dandelion and Dandelion++ are designed, increasing the network size does not correspond to an increase in the anonymity set of potential originators. Alarmingly, our longitudinal analysis of Lightning Network reveals rather an inverse trend -- with the growth of the network the overall anonymity decreases.

**Abstracts**: One major goal of the AI security community is to securely and reliably produce and deploy deep learning models for real-world applications. To this end, data poisoning based backdoor attacks on deep neural networks (DNNs) in the production stage (or training stage) and corresponding defenses are extensively explored in recent years. Ironically, backdoor attacks in the deployment stage, which can often happen in unprofessional users' devices and are thus arguably far more threatening in real-world scenarios, draw much less attention of the community. We attribute this imbalance of vigilance to the weak practicality of existing deployment-stage backdoor attack algorithms and the insufficiency of real-world attack demonstrations. To fill the blank, in this work, we study the realistic threat of deployment-stage backdoor attacks on DNNs. We base our study on a commonly used deployment-stage attack paradigm -- adversarial weight attack, where adversaries selectively modify model weights to embed backdoor into deployed DNNs. To approach realistic practicality, we propose the first gray-box and physically realizable weights attack algorithm for backdoor injection, namely subnet replacement attack (SRA), which only requires architecture information of the victim model and can support physical triggers in the real world. Extensive experimental simulations and system-level real-world attack demonstrations are conducted. Our results not only suggest the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed attack algorithm, but also reveal the practical risk of a novel type of computer virus that may widely spread and stealthily inject backdoor into DNN models in user devices. By our study, we call for more attention to the vulnerability of DNNs in the deployment stage.

**Authors**: Avishag Shapira, Alon Zolfi, Luca Demetrio, Battista Biggio, Asaf Shabtai

**Abstracts**: Adversarial attacks against deep learning-based object detectors have been studied extensively in the past few years. The proposed attacks aimed solely at compromising the models' integrity (i.e., trustworthiness of the model's prediction), while adversarial attacks targeting the models' availability, a critical aspect in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving, have not been explored by the machine learning research community. In this paper, we propose NMS-Sponge, a novel approach that negatively affects the decision latency of YOLO, a state-of-the-art object detector, and compromises the model's availability by applying a universal adversarial perturbation (UAP). In our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed UAP is able to increase the processing time of individual frames by adding "phantom" objects while preserving the detection of the original objects.

**Authors**: Xiangyu Qi, Tinghao Xie, Saeed Mahloujifar, Prateek Mittal

**Abstracts**: Deep learning models are vulnerable to backdoor poisoning attacks. In particular, adversaries can embed hidden backdoors into a model by only modifying a very small portion of its training data. On the other hand, it has also been commonly observed that backdoor poisoning attacks tend to leave a tangible signature in the latent space of the backdoored model i.e. poison samples and clean samples form two separable clusters in the latent space. These observations give rise to the popularity of latent separability assumption, which states that the backdoored DNN models will learn separable latent representations for poison and clean populations. A number of popular defenses (e.g. Spectral Signature, Activation Clustering, SCAn, etc.) are exactly built upon this assumption. However, in this paper, we show that the latent separation can be significantly suppressed via designing adaptive backdoor poisoning attacks with more sophisticated poison strategies, which consequently render state-of-the-art defenses based on this assumption less effective (and often completely fail). More interestingly, we find that our adaptive attacks can even evade some other typical backdoor defenses that do not explicitly build on this separability assumption. Our results show that adaptive backdoor poisoning attacks that can breach the latent separability assumption should be seriously considered for evaluating existing and future defenses.



## **32. PerDoor: Persistent Non-Uniform Backdoors in Federated Learning using Adversarial Perturbations**

**SubmitDate**: 2022-05-26    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.13523v1)

**Authors**: Manaar Alam, Esha Sarkar, Michail Maniatakos

**Abstracts**: Federated Learning (FL) enables numerous participants to train deep learning models collaboratively without exposing their personal, potentially sensitive data, making it a promising solution for data privacy in collaborative training. The distributed nature of FL and unvetted data, however, makes it inherently vulnerable to backdoor attacks: In this scenario, an adversary injects backdoor functionality into the centralized model during training, which can be triggered to cause the desired misclassification for a specific adversary-chosen input. A range of prior work establishes successful backdoor injection in an FL system; however, these backdoors are not demonstrated to be long-lasting. The backdoor functionality does not remain in the system if the adversary is removed from the training process since the centralized model parameters continuously mutate during successive FL training rounds. Therefore, in this work, we propose PerDoor, a persistent-by-construction backdoor injection technique for FL, driven by adversarial perturbation and targeting parameters of the centralized model that deviate less in successive FL rounds and contribute the least to the main task accuracy. An exhaustive evaluation considering an image classification scenario portrays on average $10.5\times$ persistence over multiple FL rounds compared to traditional backdoor attacks. Through experiments, we further exhibit the potency of PerDoor in the presence of state-of-the-art backdoor prevention techniques in an FL system. Additionally, the operation of adversarial perturbation also assists PerDoor in developing non-uniform trigger patterns for backdoor inputs compared to uniform triggers (with fixed patterns and locations) of existing backdoor techniques, which are prone to be easily mitigated.

**Authors**: Ramin Barati, Reza Safabakhsh, Mohammad Rahmati

**Abstracts**: The reliability of a learning model is key to the successful deployment of machine learning in various industries. Creating a robust model, particularly one unaffected by adversarial attacks, requires a comprehensive understanding of the adversarial examples phenomenon. However, it is difficult to describe the phenomenon due to the complicated nature of the problems in machine learning. Consequently, many studies investigate the phenomenon by proposing a simplified model of how adversarial examples occur and validate it by predicting some aspect of the phenomenon. While these studies cover many different characteristics of the adversarial examples, they have not reached a holistic approach to the geometric and analytic modeling of the phenomenon. This paper propose a formal framework to study the phenomenon in learning theory and make use of complex analysis and holomorphicity to offer a robust learning rule for artificial neural networks. With the help of complex analysis, we can effortlessly move between geometric and analytic perspectives of the phenomenon and offer further insights on the phenomenon by revealing its connection with harmonic functions. Using our model, we can explain some of the most intriguing characteristics of adversarial examples, including transferability of adversarial examples, and pave the way for novel approaches to mitigate the effects of the phenomenon.



## **34. Towards Understanding and Harnessing the Effect of Image Transformation in Adversarial Detection**

**Authors**: Hui Liu, Bo Zhao, Yuefeng Peng, Weidong Li, Peng Liu

**Abstracts**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are threatened by adversarial examples. Adversarial detection, which distinguishes adversarial images from benign images, is fundamental for robust DNN-based services. Image transformation is one of the most effective approaches to detect adversarial examples. During the last few years, a variety of image transformations have been studied and discussed to design reliable adversarial detectors. In this paper, we systematically synthesize the recent progress on adversarial detection via image transformations with a novel classification method. Then, we conduct extensive experiments to test the detection performance of image transformations against state-of-the-art adversarial attacks. Furthermore, we reveal that each individual transformation is not capable of detecting adversarial examples in a robust way, and propose a DNN-based approach referred to as \emph{AdvJudge}, which combines scores of 9 image transformations. Without knowing which individual scores are misleading or not misleading, AdvJudge can make the right judgment, and achieve a significant improvement in detection rate. Finally, we utilize an explainable AI tool to show the contribution of each image transformation to adversarial detection. Experimental results show that the contribution of image transformations to adversarial detection is significantly different, the combination of them can significantly improve the generic detection ability against state-of-the-art adversarial attacks.

**Authors**: Yanjie Li, Yiquan Li, Bin Xiao

**Abstracts**: 3D face recognition systems have been widely employed in intelligent terminals, among which structured light imaging is a common method to measure the 3D shape. However, this method could be easily attacked, leading to inaccurate 3D face recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel, physically-achievable attack on the fringe structured light system, named structured light attack. The attack utilizes a projector to project optical adversarial fringes on faces to generate point clouds with well-designed noises. We firstly propose a 3D transform-invariant loss function to enhance the robustness of 3D adversarial examples in the physical-world attack. Then we reverse the 3D adversarial examples to the projector's input to place noises on phase-shift images, which models the process of structured light imaging. A real-world structured light system is constructed for the attack and several state-of-the-art 3D face recognition neural networks are tested. Experiments show that our method can attack the physical system successfully and only needs minor modifications of projected images.

**Authors**: Zhenting Wang, Juan Zhai, Shiqing Ma

**Abstracts**: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to Trojan attacks. Existing attacks use visible patterns (e.g., a patch or image transformations) as triggers, which are vulnerable to human inspection. In this paper, we propose stealthy and efficient Trojan attacks, BppAttack. Based on existing biology literature on human visual systems, we propose to use image quantization and dithering as the Trojan trigger, making imperceptible changes. It is a stealthy and efficient attack without training auxiliary models. Due to the small changes made to images, it is hard to inject such triggers during training. To alleviate this problem, we propose a contrastive learning based approach that leverages adversarial attacks to generate negative sample pairs so that the learned trigger is precise and accurate. The proposed method achieves high attack success rates on four benchmark datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and CelebA. It also effectively bypasses existing Trojan defenses and human inspection. Our code can be found in https://github.com/RU-System-Software-and-Security/BppAttack.

**Authors**: Amir Belder, Gal Yefet, Ran Ben Izhak, Ayellet Tal

**Abstracts**: A polygonal mesh is the most-commonly used representation of surfaces in computer graphics. Therefore, it is not surprising that a number of mesh classification networks have recently been proposed. However, while adversarial attacks are wildly researched in 2D, the field of adversarial meshes is under explored. This paper proposes a novel, unified, and general adversarial attack, which leads to misclassification of several state-of-the-art mesh classification neural networks. Our attack approach is black-box, i.e. it has access only to the network's predictions, but not to the network's full architecture or gradients. The key idea is to train a network to imitate a given classification network. This is done by utilizing random walks along the mesh surface, which gather geometric information. These walks provide insight onto the regions of the mesh that are important for the correct prediction of the given classification network. These mesh regions are then modified more than other regions in order to attack the network in a manner that is barely visible to the naked eye.

**Authors**: Kang Liu, Di Wu, Yiru Wang, Dan Feng, Benjamin Tan, Siddharth Garg

**Abstracts**: Deep learning techniques have shown promising results in image compression, with competitive bitrate and image reconstruction quality from compressed latent. However, while image compression has progressed towards higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and fewer bits per pixel (bpp), their robustness to corner-case images has never received deliberation. In this work, we, for the first time, investigate the robustness of image compression systems where imperceptible perturbation of input images can precipitate a significant increase in the bitrate of their compressed latent. To characterize the robustness of state-of-the-art learned image compression, we mount white and black-box attacks. Our results on several image compression models with various bitrate qualities show that they are surprisingly fragile, where the white-box attack achieves up to 56.326x and black-box 1.947x bpp change. To improve robustness, we propose a novel model which incorporates attention modules and a basic factorized entropy model, resulting in a promising trade-off between the PSNR/bpp ratio and robustness to adversarial attacks that surpasses existing learned image compressors.

**Authors**: Haiteng Zhao, Chang Ma*, Xinshuai Dong, Anh Tuan Luu, Zhi-Hong Deng, Hanwang Zhang

**Abstracts**: Deep learning models have achieved great success in many fields, yet they are vulnerable to adversarial examples. This paper follows a causal perspective to look into the adversarial vulnerability and proposes Causal Intervention by Semantic Smoothing (CISS), a novel framework towards robustness against natural language attacks. Instead of merely fitting observational data, CISS learns causal effects p(y|do(x)) by smoothing in the latent semantic space to make robust predictions, which scales to deep architectures and avoids tedious construction of noise customized for specific attacks. CISS is provably robust against word substitution attacks, as well as empirically robust even when perturbations are strengthened by unknown attack algorithms. For example, on YELP, CISS surpasses the runner-up by 6.7% in terms of certified robustness against word substitutions, and achieves 79.4% empirical robustness when syntactic attacks are integrated.

**Authors**: Yi Huang, Adams Wai-Kin Kong

**Abstracts**: The vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial examples has drawn tremendous attention from the community. Three approaches, optimizing standard objective functions, exploiting attention maps, and smoothing decision surfaces, are commonly used to craft adversarial examples. By tightly integrating the three approaches, we propose a new and simple algorithm named Transferable Attack based on Integrated Gradients (TAIG) in this paper, which can find highly transferable adversarial examples for black-box attacks. Unlike previous methods using multiple computational terms or combining with other methods, TAIG integrates the three approaches into one single term. Two versions of TAIG that compute their integrated gradients on a straight-line path and a random piecewise linear path are studied. Both versions offer strong transferability and can seamlessly work together with the previous methods. Experimental results demonstrate that TAIG outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

**Authors**: Jun Yan, Vansh Gupta, Xiang Ren

**Abstracts**: The backdoor attack has become an emerging threat for Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. A victim model trained on poisoned data can be embedded with a "backdoor", making it predict the adversary-specified output (e.g., the positive sentiment label) on inputs satisfying the trigger pattern (e.g., containing a certain keyword). In this paper, we demonstrate that it's possible to design an effective and stealthy backdoor attack by iteratively injecting "triggers" into a small set of training data. While all triggers are common words that fit into the context, our poisoning process strongly associates them with the target label, forming the model backdoor. Experiments on sentiment analysis and hate speech detection show that our proposed attack is both stealthy and effective, raising alarm on the usage of untrusted training data. We further propose a defense method to combat this threat.

**Authors**: Yong Xu, Zhihua Xia, Zichi Wang, Xinpeng Zhang, Jian Weng

**Abstracts**: Steganography conceals the secret message into the cover media, generating a stego media which can be transmitted on public channels without drawing suspicion. As its countermeasure, steganalysis mainly aims to detect whether the secret message is hidden in a given media. Although the steganography techniques are improving constantly, the sophisticated steganalysis can always break a known steganographic method to some extent. With a stego media discovered, the adversary could find out the sender or receiver and coerce them to disclose the secret message, which we name as coercive attack in this paper. Inspired by the idea of deniable encryption, we build up the concepts of deniable steganography for the first time and discuss the feasible constructions for it. As an example, we propose a receiver-deniable steganographic scheme to deal with the receiver-side coercive attack using deep neural networks (DNN). Specifically, besides the real secret message, a piece of fake message is also embedded into the cover. On the receiver side, the real message can be extracted with an extraction module; while once the receiver has to surrender a piece of secret message under coercive attack, he can extract the fake message to deceive the adversary with another extraction module. Experiments demonstrate the scalability and sensitivity of the DNN-based receiver-deniable steganographic scheme.

**Authors**: Vera Wesselkamp, Konrad Rieck, Daniel Arp, Erwin Quiring

**Abstracts**: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have made remarkable progress in synthesizing realistic-looking images that effectively outsmart even humans. Although several detection methods can recognize these deep fakes by checking for image artifacts from the generation process, multiple counterattacks have demonstrated their limitations. These attacks, however, still require certain conditions to hold, such as interacting with the detection method or adjusting the GAN directly. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of simple counterattacks that overcomes these limitations. In particular, we show that an adversary can remove indicative artifacts, the GAN fingerprint, directly from the frequency spectrum of a generated image. We explore different realizations of this removal, ranging from filtering high frequencies to more nuanced frequency-peak cleansing. We evaluate the performance of our attack with different detection methods, GAN architectures, and datasets. Our results show that an adversary can often remove GAN fingerprints and thus evade the detection of generated images.

**Abstracts**: As the scale of networked control systems increases and interactions between different subsystems become more sophisticated, questions of the resilience of such networks increase in importance. The need to redefine classical system and control-theoretic notions using the language of graphs has recently started to gain attention as a fertile and important area of research. This paper presents an overview of graph-theoretic methods for analyzing the resilience of networked control systems. We discuss various distributed algorithms operating on networked systems and investigate their resilience against adversarial actions by looking at the structural properties of their underlying networks. We present graph-theoretic methods to quantify the attack impact, and reinterpret some system-theoretic notions of robustness from a graph-theoretic standpoint to mitigate the impact of the attacks. Moreover, we discuss miscellaneous problems in the security of networked control systems which use graph-theory as a tool in their analyses. We conclude by introducing some avenues for further research in this field.



## **45. Label Leakage and Protection from Forward Embedding in Vertical Federated Learning**

**Authors**: Jiankai Sun, Xin Yang, Yuanshun Yao, Chong Wang

**Abstracts**: Vertical federated learning (vFL) has gained much attention and been deployed to solve machine learning problems with data privacy concerns in recent years. However, some recent work demonstrated that vFL is vulnerable to privacy leakage even though only the forward intermediate embedding (rather than raw features) and backpropagated gradients (rather than raw labels) are communicated between the involved participants. As the raw labels often contain highly sensitive information, some recent work has been proposed to prevent the label leakage from the backpropagated gradients effectively in vFL. However, these work only identified and defended the threat of label leakage from the backpropagated gradients. None of these work has paid attention to the problem of label leakage from the intermediate embedding. In this paper, we propose a practical label inference method which can steal private labels effectively from the shared intermediate embedding even though some existing protection methods such as label differential privacy and gradients perturbation are applied. The effectiveness of the label attack is inseparable from the correlation between the intermediate embedding and corresponding private labels. To mitigate the issue of label leakage from the forward embedding, we add an additional optimization goal at the label party to limit the label stealing ability of the adversary by minimizing the distance correlation between the intermediate embedding and corresponding private labels. We conducted massive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed protection methods.

**Abstracts**: Learning effective recipe representations is essential in food studies. Unlike what has been developed for image-based recipe retrieval or learning structural text embeddings, the combined effect of multi-modal information (i.e., recipe images, text, and relation data) receives less attention. In this paper, we formalize the problem of multi-modal recipe representation learning to integrate the visual, textual, and relational information into recipe embeddings. In particular, we first present Large-RG, a new recipe graph data with over half a million nodes, making it the largest recipe graph to date. We then propose Recipe2Vec, a novel graph neural network based recipe embedding model to capture multi-modal information. Additionally, we introduce an adversarial attack strategy to ensure stable learning and improve performance. Finally, we design a joint objective function of node classification and adversarial learning to optimize the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Recipe2Vec outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on two classic food study tasks, i.e., cuisine category classification and region prediction. Dataset and codes are available at https://github.com/meettyj/Recipe2Vec.

**Authors**: Oscar Li, Jiankai Sun, Xin Yang, Weihao Gao, Hongyi Zhang, Junyuan Xie, Virginia Smith, Chong Wang

**Abstracts**: Two-party split learning is a popular technique for learning a model across feature-partitioned data. In this work, we explore whether it is possible for one party to steal the private label information from the other party during split training, and whether there are methods that can protect against such attacks. Specifically, we first formulate a realistic threat model and propose a privacy loss metric to quantify label leakage in split learning. We then show that there exist two simple yet effective methods within the threat model that can allow one party to accurately recover private ground-truth labels owned by the other party. To combat these attacks, we propose several random perturbation techniques, including $\texttt{Marvell}$, an approach that strategically finds the structure of the noise perturbation by minimizing the amount of label leakage (measured through our quantification metric) of a worst-case adversary. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our protection techniques against the identified attacks, and show that $\texttt{Marvell}$ in particular has improved privacy-utility tradeoffs relative to baseline approaches.

**Abstracts**: Recent self-propagating malware (SPM) campaigns compromised hundred of thousands of victim machines on the Internet. It is challenging to detect these attacks in their early stages, as adversaries utilize common network services, use novel techniques, and can evade existing detection mechanisms. We propose PORTFILER (PORT-Level Network Traffic ProFILER), a new machine learning system applied to network traffic for detecting SPM attacks. PORTFILER extracts port-level features from the Zeek connection logs collected at a border of a monitored network, applies anomaly detection techniques to identify suspicious events, and ranks the alerts across ports for investigation by the Security Operations Center (SOC). We propose a novel ensemble methodology for aggregating individual models in PORTFILER that increases resilience against several evasion strategies compared to standard ML baselines. We extensively evaluate PORTFILER on traffic collected from two university networks, and show that it can detect SPM attacks with different patterns, such as WannaCry and Mirai, and performs well under evasion. Ranking across ports achieves precision over 0.94 with low false positive rates in the top ranked alerts. When deployed on the university networks, PORTFILER detected anomalous SPM-like activity on one of the campus networks, confirmed by the university SOC as malicious. PORTFILER also detected a Mirai attack recreated on the two university networks with higher precision and recall than deep-learning-based autoencoder methods.

**Abstracts**: In this paper, we present an approach to improve the robustness of BERT language models against word substitution-based adversarial attacks by leveraging adversarial perturbations for self-supervised contrastive learning. We create a word-level adversarial attack generating hard positives on-the-fly as adversarial examples during contrastive learning. In contrast to previous works, our method improves model robustness without using any labeled data. Experimental results show that our method improves robustness of BERT against four different word substitution-based adversarial attacks, and combining our method with adversarial training gives higher robustness than adversarial training alone. As our method improves the robustness of BERT purely with unlabeled data, it opens up the possibility of using large text datasets to train robust language models against word substitution-based adversarial attacks.

**Abstracts**: The score-based query attacks (SQAs) pose practical threats to deep neural networks by crafting adversarial perturbations within dozens of queries, only using the model's output scores. Nonetheless, we note that if the loss trend of the outputs is slightly perturbed, SQAs could be easily misled and thereby become much less effective. Following this idea, we propose a novel defense, namely Adversarial Attack on Attackers (AAA), to confound SQAs towards incorrect attack directions by slightly modifying the output logits. In this way, (1) SQAs are prevented regardless of the model's worst-case robustness; (2) the original model predictions are hardly changed, i.e., no degradation on clean accuracy; (3) the calibration of confidence scores can be improved simultaneously. Extensive experiments are provided to verify the above advantages. For example, by setting $\ell_\infty=8/255$ on CIFAR-10, our proposed AAA helps WideResNet-28 secure $80.59\%$ accuracy under Square attack ($2500$ queries), while the best prior defense (i.e., adversarial training) only attains $67.44\%$. Since AAA attacks SQA's general greedy strategy, such advantages of AAA over 8 defenses can be consistently observed on 8 CIFAR-10/ImageNet models under 6 SQAs, using different attack targets and bounds. Moreover, AAA calibrates better without hurting the accuracy. Our code would be released.
