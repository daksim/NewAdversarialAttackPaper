cs.CV

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-06    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.02684v1)

**Authors**: Zichao Li, Li Liu, Zeyu Wang, Yuyin Zhou, Cihang Xie

**Abstracts**: Adversarial training (AT) with samples generated by Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), also known as FGSM-AT, is a computationally simple method to train robust networks. However, during its training procedure, an unstable mode of "catastrophic overfitting" has been identified in arXiv:2001.03994 [cs.LG], where the robust accuracy abruptly drops to zero within a single training step. Existing methods use gradient regularizers or random initialization tricks to attenuate this issue, whereas they either take high computational cost or lead to lower robust accuracy. In this work, we provide the first study, which thoroughly examines a collection of tricks from three perspectives: Data Initialization, Network Structure, and Optimization, to overcome the catastrophic overfitting in FGSM-AT.   Surprisingly, we find that simple tricks, i.e., a) masking partial pixels (even without randomness), b) setting a large convolution stride and smooth activation functions, or c) regularizing the weights of the first convolutional layer, can effectively tackle the overfitting issue. Extensive results on a range of network architectures validate the effectiveness of each proposed trick, and the combinations of tricks are also investigated. For example, trained with PreActResNet-18 on CIFAR-10, our method attains 49.8% accuracy against PGD-50 attacker and 46.4% accuracy against AutoAttack, demonstrating that pure FGSM-AT is capable of enabling robust learners. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/Bag-of-Tricks-for-FGSM-AT.



## **2. Improving the Accuracy and Robustness of CNNs Using a Deep CCA Neural Data Regularizer**

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-06    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.02582v1)

**Authors**: Cassidy Pirlot, Richard C. Gerum, Cory Efird, Joel Zylberberg, Alona Fyshe

**Abstracts**: As convolutional neural networks (CNNs) become more accurate at object recognition, their representations become more similar to the primate visual system. This finding has inspired us and other researchers to ask if the implication also runs the other way: If CNN representations become more brain-like, does the network become more accurate? Previous attempts to address this question showed very modest gains in accuracy, owing in part to limitations of the regularization method. To overcome these limitations, we developed a new neural data regularizer for CNNs that uses Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA) to optimize the resemblance of the CNN's image representations to that of the monkey visual cortex. Using this new neural data regularizer, we see much larger performance gains in both classification accuracy and within-super-class accuracy, as compared to the previous state-of-the-art neural data regularizers. These networks are also more robust to adversarial attacks than their unregularized counterparts. Together, these results confirm that neural data regularization can push CNN performance higher, and introduces a new method that obtains a larger performance boost.



## **3. Instance Attack:An Explanation-based Vulnerability Analysis Framework Against DNNs for Malware Detection**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-06    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.02453v1)

**Authors**: Sun RuiJin, Guo ShiZe, Guo JinHong, Xing ChangYou, Yang LuMing, Guo Xi, Pan ZhiSong

**Abstracts**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being applied in malware detection and their robustness has been widely debated. Traditionally an adversarial example generation scheme relies on either detailed model information (gradient-based methods) or lots of samples to train a surrogate model, neither of which are available in most scenarios.   We propose the notion of the instance-based attack. Our scheme is interpretable and can work in a black-box environment. Given a specific binary example and a malware classifier, we use the data augmentation strategies to produce enough data from which we can train a simple interpretable model. We explain the detection model by displaying the weight of different parts of the specific binary. By analyzing the explanations, we found that the data subsections play an important role in Windows PE malware detection. We proposed a new function preserving transformation algorithm that can be applied to data subsections. By employing the binary-diversification techniques that we proposed, we eliminated the influence of the most weighted part to generate adversarial examples. Our algorithm can fool the DNNs in certain cases with a success rate of nearly 100\%. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method . The most important aspect is that our method operates in black-box settings and the results can be validated with domain knowledge. Our analysis model can assist people in improving the robustness of malware detectors.



## **4. MACAB: Model-Agnostic Clean-Annotation Backdoor to Object Detection with Natural Trigger in Real-World**

cs.CV

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-06    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.02339v1)

**Authors**: Hua Ma, Yinshan Li, Yansong Gao, Zhi Zhang, Alsharif Abuadbba, Anmin Fu, Said F. Al-Sarawi, Nepal Surya, Derek Abbott

**Abstracts**: Object detection is the foundation of various critical computer-vision tasks such as segmentation, object tracking, and event detection. To train an object detector with satisfactory accuracy, a large amount of data is required. However, due to the intensive workforce involved with annotating large datasets, such a data curation task is often outsourced to a third party or relied on volunteers. This work reveals severe vulnerabilities of such data curation pipeline. We propose MACAB that crafts clean-annotated images to stealthily implant the backdoor into the object detectors trained on them even when the data curator can manually audit the images. We observe that the backdoor effect of both misclassification and the cloaking are robustly achieved in the wild when the backdoor is activated with inconspicuously natural physical triggers. Backdooring non-classification object detection with clean-annotation is challenging compared to backdooring existing image classification tasks with clean-label, owing to the complexity of having multiple objects within each frame, including victim and non-victim objects. The efficacy of the MACAB is ensured by constructively i abusing the image-scaling function used by the deep learning framework, ii incorporating the proposed adversarial clean image replica technique, and iii combining poison data selection criteria given constrained attacking budget. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MACAB exhibits more than 90% attack success rate under various real-world scenes. This includes both cloaking and misclassification backdoor effect even restricted with a small attack budget. The poisoned samples cannot be effectively identified by state-of-the-art detection techniques.The comprehensive video demo is at https://youtu.be/MA7L_LpXkp4, which is based on a poison rate of 0.14% for YOLOv4 cloaking backdoor and Faster R-CNN misclassification backdoor.



## **5. A Survey of Machine Unlearning**

cs.LG

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-06    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.02299v1)

**Authors**: Thanh Tam Nguyen, Thanh Trung Huynh, Phi Le Nguyen, Alan Wee-Chung Liew, Hongzhi Yin, Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen

**Abstracts**: Computer systems hold a large amount of personal data over decades. On the one hand, such data abundance allows breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI), especially machine learning (ML) models. On the other hand, it can threaten the privacy of users and weaken the trust between humans and AI. Recent regulations require that private information about a user can be removed from computer systems in general and from ML models in particular upon request (e.g. the "right to be forgotten"). While removing data from back-end databases should be straightforward, it is not sufficient in the AI context as ML models often "remember" the old data. Existing adversarial attacks proved that we can learn private membership or attributes of the training data from the trained models. This phenomenon calls for a new paradigm, namely machine unlearning, to make ML models forget about particular data. It turns out that recent works on machine unlearning have not been able to solve the problem completely due to the lack of common frameworks and resources. In this survey paper, we seek to provide a thorough investigation of machine unlearning in its definitions, scenarios, mechanisms, and applications. Specifically, as a categorical collection of state-of-the-art research, we hope to provide a broad reference for those seeking a primer on machine unlearning and its various formulations, design requirements, removal requests, algorithms, and uses in a variety of ML applications. Furthermore, we hope to outline key findings and trends in the paradigm as well as highlight new areas of research that have yet to see the application of machine unlearning, but could nonetheless benefit immensely. We hope this survey provides a valuable reference for ML researchers as well as those seeking to innovate privacy technologies.

## **6. White-Box Adversarial Policies in Deep Reinforcement Learning**

cs.AI

Code is available at  https://github.com/thestephencasper/white_box_rarl

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-05    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.02167v1)

**Authors**: Stephen Casper, Dylan Hadfield-Menell, Gabriel Kreiman

**Abstracts**: Adversarial examples against AI systems pose both risks via malicious attacks and opportunities for improving robustness via adversarial training. In multiagent settings, adversarial policies can be developed by training an adversarial agent to minimize a victim agent's rewards. Prior work has studied black-box attacks where the adversary only sees the state observations and effectively treats the victim as any other part of the environment. In this work, we experiment with white-box adversarial policies to study whether an agent's internal state can offer useful information for other agents. We make three contributions. First, we introduce white-box adversarial policies in which an attacker can observe a victim's internal state at each timestep. Second, we demonstrate that white-box access to a victim makes for better attacks in two-agent environments, resulting in both faster initial learning and higher asymptotic performance against the victim. Third, we show that training against white-box adversarial policies can be used to make learners in single-agent environments more robust to domain shifts.



## **7. Reinforcement learning-based optimised control for tracking of nonlinear systems with adversarial attacks**

eess.SY

Submitted for The 10th RSI International Conference on Robotics and  Mechatronics (ICRoM 2022)

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-05    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.02165v1)

**Authors**: Farshad Rahimi, Sepideh Ziaei

**Abstracts**: This paper introduces a reinforcement learning-based tracking control approach for a class of nonlinear systems using neural networks. In this approach, adversarial attacks were considered both in the actuator and on the outputs. This approach incorporates a simultaneous tracking and optimization process. It is necessary to be able to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation (HJB) in order to obtain optimal control input, but this is difficult due to the strong nonlinearity terms in the equation. In order to find the solution to the HJB equation, we used a reinforcement learning approach. In this online adaptive learning approach, three neural networks are simultaneously adapted: the critic neural network, the actor neural network, and the adversary neural network. Ultimately, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the introduced method on a manipulator.



## **8. On the Anonymity of Peer-To-Peer Network Anonymity Schemes Used by Cryptocurrencies**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-05    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11860v3)

**Authors**: Piyush Kumar Sharma, Devashish Gosain, Claudia Diaz

**Abstracts**: Cryptocurrency systems can be subject to deanonimization attacks by exploiting the network-level communication on their peer-to-peer network. Adversaries who control a set of colluding node(s) within the peer-to-peer network can observe transactions being exchanged and infer the parties involved. Thus, various network anonymity schemes have been proposed to mitigate this problem, with some solutions providing theoretical anonymity guarantees.   In this work, we model such peer-to-peer network anonymity solutions and evaluate their anonymity guarantees. To do so, we propose a novel framework that uses Bayesian inference to obtain the probability distributions linking transactions to their possible originators. We characterize transaction anonymity with those distributions, using entropy as metric of adversarial uncertainty on the originator's identity. In particular, we model Dandelion, Dandelion++ and Lightning Network. We study different configurations and demonstrate that none of them offers acceptable anonymity to their users. For instance, our analysis reveals that in the widely deployed Lightning Network, with 1% strategically chosen colluding nodes the adversary can uniquely determine the originator for about 50% of the total transactions in the network. In Dandelion, an adversary that controls 15% of the nodes has on average uncertainty among only 8 possible originators. Moreover, we observe that due to the way Dandelion and Dandelion++ are designed, increasing the network size does not correspond to an increase in the anonymity set of potential originators. Alarmingly, our longitudinal analysis of Lightning Network reveals rather an inverse trend -- with the growth of the network the overall anonymity decreases.



## **9. Evaluating the Susceptibility of Pre-Trained Language Models via Handcrafted Adversarial Examples**

cs.CL

10 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-05    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.02128v1)

**Authors**: Hezekiah J. Branch, Jonathan Rodriguez Cefalu, Jeremy McHugh, Leyla Hujer, Aditya Bahl, Daniel del Castillo Iglesias, Ron Heichman, Ramesh Darwishi

**Abstracts**: Recent advances in the development of large language models have resulted in public access to state-of-the-art pre-trained language models (PLMs), including Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). However, evaluations of PLMs, in practice, have shown their susceptibility to adversarial attacks during the training and fine-tuning stages of development. Such attacks can result in erroneous outputs, model-generated hate speech, and the exposure of users' sensitive information. While existing research has focused on adversarial attacks during either the training or the fine-tuning of PLMs, there is a deficit of information on attacks made between these two development phases. In this work, we highlight a major security vulnerability in the public release of GPT-3 and further investigate this vulnerability in other state-of-the-art PLMs. We restrict our work to pre-trained models that have not undergone fine-tuning. Further, we underscore token distance-minimized perturbations as an effective adversarial approach, bypassing both supervised and unsupervised quality measures. Following this approach, we observe a significant decrease in text classification quality when evaluating for semantic similarity.



## **10. PatchZero: Defending against Adversarial Patch Attacks by Detecting and Zeroing the Patch**

cs.CV

Accepted to WACV 2023

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-05    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01795v3)

**Authors**: Ke Xu, Yao Xiao, Zhaoheng Zheng, Kaijie Cai, Ram Nevatia

**Abstracts**: Adversarial patch attacks mislead neural networks by injecting adversarial pixels within a local region. Patch attacks can be highly effective in a variety of tasks and physically realizable via attachment (e.g. a sticker) to the real-world objects. Despite the diversity in attack patterns, adversarial patches tend to be highly textured and different in appearance from natural images. We exploit this property and present PatchZero, a general defense pipeline against white-box adversarial patches without retraining the downstream classifier or detector. Specifically, our defense detects adversaries at the pixel-level and "zeros out" the patch region by repainting with mean pixel values. We further design a two-stage adversarial training scheme to defend against the stronger adaptive attacks. PatchZero achieves SOTA defense performance on the image classification (ImageNet, RESISC45), object detection (PASCAL VOC), and video classification (UCF101) tasks with little degradation in benign performance. In addition, PatchZero transfers to different patch shapes and attack types.



## **11. Adversarial Detection: Attacking Object Detection in Real Time**

cs.AI

7 pages, 10 figures

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-05    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.01962v1)

**Authors**: Han Wu, Syed Yunas, Sareh Rowlands, Wenjie Ruan, Johan Wahlstrom

**Abstracts**: Intelligent robots hinge on accurate object detection models to perceive the environment. Advances in deep learning security unveil that object detection models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, prior research primarily focuses on attacking static images or offline videos. It is still unclear if such attacks could jeopardize real-world robotic applications in dynamic environments. There is still a gap between theoretical discoveries and real-world applications. We bridge the gap by proposing the first real-time online attack against object detection models. We devised three attacks that fabricate bounding boxes for nonexistent objects at desired locations.



## **12. Jamming Modulation: An Active Anti-Jamming Scheme**

cs.IT

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-05    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.01943v1)

**Authors**: Jianhui Ma, Qiang Li, Zilong Liu, Linsong Du, Hongyang Chen, Nirwan Ansari

**Abstracts**: Providing quality communications under adversarial electronic attacks, e.g., broadband jamming attacks, is a challenging task. Unlike state-of-the-art approaches which treat jamming signals as destructive interference, this paper presents a novel active anti-jamming (AAJ) scheme for a jammed channel to enhance the communication quality between a transmitter node (TN) and receiver node (RN), where the TN actively exploits the jamming signal as a carrier to send messages. Specifically, the TN is equipped with a programmable-gain amplifier, which is capable of re-modulating the jamming signals for jamming modulation. Considering four typical jamming types, we derive both the bit error rates (BER) and the corresponding optimal detection thresholds of the AAJ scheme. The asymptotic performances of the AAJ scheme are discussed under the high jamming-to-noise ratio (JNR) and sampling rate cases. Our analysis shows that there exists a BER floor for sufficiently large JNR. Simulation results indicate that the proposed AAJ scheme allows the TN to communicate with the RN reliably even under extremely strong and/or broadband jamming. Additionally, we investigate the channel capacity of the proposed AAJ scheme and show that the channel capacity of the AAJ scheme outperforms that of the direct transmission when the JNR is relatively high.



## **13. Identifying a Training-Set Attack's Target Using Renormalized Influence Estimation**

cs.LG

Accepted at CCS'2022 -- Extended version including the supplementary  material

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-05    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.10055v2)

**Authors**: Zayd Hammoudeh, Daniel Lowd

**Abstracts**: Targeted training-set attacks inject malicious instances into the training set to cause a trained model to mislabel one or more specific test instances. This work proposes the task of target identification, which determines whether a specific test instance is the target of a training-set attack. Target identification can be combined with adversarial-instance identification to find (and remove) the attack instances, mitigating the attack with minimal impact on other predictions. Rather than focusing on a single attack method or data modality, we build on influence estimation, which quantifies each training instance's contribution to a model's prediction. We show that existing influence estimators' poor practical performance often derives from their over-reliance on training instances and iterations with large losses. Our renormalized influence estimators fix this weakness; they far outperform the original estimators at identifying influential groups of training examples in both adversarial and non-adversarial settings, even finding up to 100% of adversarial training instances with no clean-data false positives. Target identification then simplifies to detecting test instances with anomalous influence values. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on backdoor and poisoning attacks across various data domains, including text, vision, and speech, as well as against a gray-box, adaptive attacker that specifically optimizes the adversarial instances to evade our method. Our source code is available at https://github.com/ZaydH/target_identification.



## **14. "Is your explanation stable?": A Robustness Evaluation Framework for Feature Attribution**

cs.AI

Accepted by ACM CCS 2022

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-05    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.01782v1)

**Authors**: Yuyou Gan, Yuhao Mao, Xuhong Zhang, Shouling Ji, Yuwen Pu, Meng Han, Jianwei Yin, Ting Wang

**Abstracts**: Understanding the decision process of neural networks is hard. One vital method for explanation is to attribute its decision to pivotal features. Although many algorithms are proposed, most of them solely improve the faithfulness to the model. However, the real environment contains many random noises, which may leads to great fluctuations in the explanations. More seriously, recent works show that explanation algorithms are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. All of these make the explanation hard to trust in real scenarios.   To bridge this gap, we propose a model-agnostic method \emph{Median Test for Feature Attribution} (MeTFA) to quantify the uncertainty and increase the stability of explanation algorithms with theoretical guarantees. MeTFA has the following two functions: (1) examine whether one feature is significantly important or unimportant and generate a MeTFA-significant map to visualize the results; (2) compute the confidence interval of a feature attribution score and generate a MeTFA-smoothed map to increase the stability of the explanation. Experiments show that MeTFA improves the visual quality of explanations and significantly reduces the instability while maintaining the faithfulness. To quantitatively evaluate the faithfulness of an explanation under different noise settings, we further propose several robust faithfulness metrics. Experiment results show that the MeTFA-smoothed explanation can significantly increase the robust faithfulness. In addition, we use two scenarios to show MeTFA's potential in the applications. First, when applied to the SOTA explanation method to locate context bias for semantic segmentation models, MeTFA-significant explanations use far smaller regions to maintain 99\%+ faithfulness. Second, when tested with different explanation-oriented attacks, MeTFA can help defend vanilla, as well as adaptive, adversarial attacks against explanations.



## **15. An Adaptive Black-box Defense against Trojan Attacks (TrojDef)**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-05    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.01721v1)

**Authors**: Guanxiong Liu, Abdallah Khreishah, Fatima Sharadgah, Issa Khalil

**Abstracts**: Trojan backdoor is a poisoning attack against Neural Network (NN) classifiers in which adversaries try to exploit the (highly desirable) model reuse property to implant Trojans into model parameters for backdoor breaches through a poisoned training process. Most of the proposed defenses against Trojan attacks assume a white-box setup, in which the defender either has access to the inner state of NN or is able to run back-propagation through it. In this work, we propose a more practical black-box defense, dubbed TrojDef, which can only run forward-pass of the NN. TrojDef tries to identify and filter out Trojan inputs (i.e., inputs augmented with the Trojan trigger) by monitoring the changes in the prediction confidence when the input is repeatedly perturbed by random noise. We derive a function based on the prediction outputs which is called the prediction confidence bound to decide whether the input example is Trojan or not. The intuition is that Trojan inputs are more stable as the misclassification only depends on the trigger, while benign inputs will suffer when augmented with noise due to the perturbation of the classification features.   Through mathematical analysis, we show that if the attacker is perfect in injecting the backdoor, the Trojan infected model will be trained to learn the appropriate prediction confidence bound, which is used to distinguish Trojan and benign inputs under arbitrary perturbations. However, because the attacker might not be perfect in injecting the backdoor, we introduce a nonlinear transform to the prediction confidence bound to improve the detection accuracy in practical settings. Extensive empirical evaluations show that TrojDef significantly outperforms the-state-of-the-art defenses and is highly stable under different settings, even when the classifier architecture, the training process, or the hyper-parameters change.



## **16. Autonomous Cross Domain Adaptation under Extreme Label Scarcity**

cs.LG

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-04    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.01548v1)

**Authors**: Weiwei Weng, Mahardhika Pratama, Choiru Za'in, Marcus De Carvalho, Rakaraddi Appan, Andri Ashfahani, Edward Yapp Kien Yee

**Abstracts**: A cross domain multistream classification is a challenging problem calling for fast domain adaptations to handle different but related streams in never-ending and rapidly changing environments. Notwithstanding that existing multistream classifiers assume no labelled samples in the target stream, they still incur expensive labelling cost since they require fully labelled samples of the source stream. This paper aims to attack the problem of extreme label shortage in the cross domain multistream classification problems where only very few labelled samples of the source stream are provided before process runs. Our solution, namely Learning Streaming Process from Partial Ground Truth (LEOPARD), is built upon a flexible deep clustering network where its hidden nodes, layers and clusters are added and removed dynamically in respect to varying data distributions. A deep clustering strategy is underpinned by a simultaneous feature learning and clustering technique leading to clustering-friendly latent spaces. A domain adaptation strategy relies on the adversarial domain adaptation technique where a feature extractor is trained to fool a domain classifier classifying source and target streams. Our numerical study demonstrates the efficacy of LEOPARD where it delivers improved performances compared to prominent algorithms in 15 of 24 cases. Source codes of LEOPARD are shared in \url{https://github.com/wengweng001/LEOPARD.git} to enable further study.



## **17. Are Attribute Inference Attacks Just Imputation?**

cs.CR

13 (main body) + 4 (references and appendix) pages. To appear in  CCS'22

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-02    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.01292v1)

**Authors**: Bargav Jayaraman, David Evans

**Abstracts**: Models can expose sensitive information about their training data. In an attribute inference attack, an adversary has partial knowledge of some training records and access to a model trained on those records, and infers the unknown values of a sensitive feature of those records. We study a fine-grained variant of attribute inference we call \emph{sensitive value inference}, where the adversary's goal is to identify with high confidence some records from a candidate set where the unknown attribute has a particular sensitive value. We explicitly compare attribute inference with data imputation that captures the training distribution statistics, under various assumptions about the training data available to the adversary. Our main conclusions are: (1) previous attribute inference methods do not reveal more about the training data from the model than can be inferred by an adversary without access to the trained model, but with the same knowledge of the underlying distribution as needed to train the attribute inference attack; (2) black-box attribute inference attacks rarely learn anything that cannot be learned without the model; but (3) white-box attacks, which we introduce and evaluate in the paper, can reliably identify some records with the sensitive value attribute that would not be predicted without having access to the model. Furthermore, we show that proposed defenses such as differentially private training and removing vulnerable records from training do not mitigate this privacy risk. The code for our experiments is available at \url{https://github.com/bargavj/EvaluatingDPML}.



## **18. Semi-supervised Conditional GAN for Simultaneous Generation and Detection of Phishing URLs: A Game theoretic Perspective**

cs.CR

Accepted to ICMLA 2022

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-02    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.01852v2)

**Authors**: Sharif Amit Kamran, Shamik Sengupta, Alireza Tavakkoli

**Abstracts**: Spear Phishing is a type of cyber-attack where the attacker sends hyperlinks through email on well-researched targets. The objective is to obtain sensitive information by imitating oneself as a trustworthy website. In recent times, deep learning has become the standard for defending against such attacks. However, these architectures were designed with only defense in mind. Moreover, the attacker's perspective and motivation are absent while creating such models. To address this, we need a game-theoretic approach to understand the perspective of the attacker (Hacker) and the defender (Phishing URL detector). We propose a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network with novel training strategy for real-time phishing URL detection. Additionally, we train our architecture in a semi-supervised manner to distinguish between adversarial and real examples, along with detecting malicious and benign URLs. We also design two games between the attacker and defender in training and deployment settings by utilizing the game-theoretic perspective. Our experiments confirm that the proposed architecture surpasses recent state-of-the-art architectures for phishing URLs detection.



## **19. Bayesian Pseudo Labels: Expectation Maximization for Robust and Efficient Semi-Supervised Segmentation**

cs.CV

MICCAI 2022 (Early accept, Student Travel Award)

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-02    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04435v2)

**Authors**: Mou-Cheng Xu, Yukun Zhou, Chen Jin, Marius de Groot, Daniel C. Alexander, Neil P. Oxtoby, Yipeng Hu, Joseph Jacob

**Abstracts**: This paper concerns pseudo labelling in segmentation. Our contribution is fourfold. Firstly, we present a new formulation of pseudo-labelling as an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for clear statistical interpretation. Secondly, we propose a semi-supervised medical image segmentation method purely based on the original pseudo labelling, namely SegPL. We demonstrate SegPL is a competitive approach against state-of-the-art consistency regularisation based methods on semi-supervised segmentation on a 2D multi-class MRI brain tumour segmentation task and a 3D binary CT lung vessel segmentation task. The simplicity of SegPL allows less computational cost comparing to prior methods. Thirdly, we demonstrate that the effectiveness of SegPL may originate from its robustness against out-of-distribution noises and adversarial attacks. Lastly, under the EM framework, we introduce a probabilistic generalisation of SegPL via variational inference, which learns a dynamic threshold for pseudo labelling during the training. We show that SegPL with variational inference can perform uncertainty estimation on par with the gold-standard method Deep Ensemble.



## **20. Subject Membership Inference Attacks in Federated Learning**

cs.LG

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-02    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.03317v2)

**Authors**: Anshuman Suri, Pallika Kanani, Virendra J. Marathe, Daniel W. Peterson

**Abstracts**: Privacy attacks on Machine Learning (ML) models often focus on inferring the existence of particular data points in the training data. However, what the adversary really wants to know is if a particular \emph{individual}'s (\emph{subject}'s) data was included during training. In such scenarios, the adversary is more likely to have access to the distribution of a particular subject, than actual records. Furthermore, in settings like cross-silo Federated Learning (FL), a subject's data can be embodied by multiple data records that are spread across multiple organizations. Nearly all of the existing private FL literature is dedicated to studying privacy at two granularities -- item-level (individual data records), and user-level (participating user in the federation), neither of which apply to data subjects in cross-silo FL. This insight motivates us to shift our attention from the privacy of data records to the privacy of \emph{data subjects}, also known as subject-level privacy. We propose two black-box attacks for \emph{subject membership inference}, of which one assumes access to a model after each training round. Using these attacks, we estimate subject membership inference risk on real-world data for single-party models as well as FL scenarios. We find our attacks to be extremely potent, even without access to exact training records, and using the knowledge of membership for a handful of subjects. To better understand the various factors that may influence subject privacy risk in cross-silo FL settings, we systematically generate several hundred synthetic federation configurations, varying properties of the data, model design and training, and the federation itself. Finally, we investigate the effectiveness of Differential Privacy in mitigating this threat.

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-02    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.01100v1)

**Authors**: Xiuling Wang, Wendy Hui Wang

**Abstracts**: With the fast adoption of machine learning (ML) techniques, sharing of ML models is becoming popular. However, ML models are vulnerable to privacy attacks that leak information about the training data. In this work, we focus on a particular type of privacy attacks named property inference attack (PIA) which infers the sensitive properties of the training data through the access to the target ML model. In particular, we consider Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as the target model, and distribution of particular groups of nodes and links in the training graph as the target property. While the existing work has investigated PIAs that target at graph-level properties, no prior works have studied the inference of node and link properties at group level yet.   In this work, we perform the first systematic study of group property inference attacks (GPIA) against GNNs. First, we consider a taxonomy of threat models under both black-box and white-box settings with various types of adversary knowledge, and design six different attacks for these settings. We evaluate the effectiveness of these attacks through extensive experiments on three representative GNN models and three real-world graphs. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks whose accuracy outperforms the baseline approaches. Second, we analyze the underlying factors that contribute to GPIA's success, and show that the target model trained on the graphs with or without the target property represents some dissimilarity in model parameters and/or model outputs, which enables the adversary to infer the existence of the property. Further, we design a set of defense mechanisms against the GPIA attacks, and demonstrate that these mechanisms can reduce attack accuracy effectively with small loss on GNN model accuracy.

**Abstracts**: In this paper, we study the adversarial attacks on influence maximization under dynamic influence propagation models in social networks. In particular, given a known seed set S, the problem is to minimize the influence spread from S by deleting a limited number of nodes and edges. This problem reflects many application scenarios, such as blocking virus (e.g. COVID-19) propagation in social networks by quarantine and vaccination, blocking rumor spread by freezing fake accounts, or attacking competitor's influence by incentivizing some users to ignore the information from the competitor. In this paper, under the linear threshold model, we adapt the reverse influence sampling approach and provide efficient algorithms of sampling valid reverse reachable paths to solve the problem.

**Authors**: Chengyin Hu, Weiwen Shi

**Abstracts**: It is well known that the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) is susceptible to subtle interference. So far, camera-based physical adversarial attacks haven't gotten much attention, but it is the vacancy of physical attack. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient camera-based physical attack called Adversarial Color Film (AdvCF), which manipulates the physical parameters of color film to perform attacks. Carefully designed experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method in both digital and physical environments. In addition, experimental results show that the adversarial samples generated by AdvCF have excellent performance in attack transferability, which enables AdvCF effective black-box attacks. At the same time, we give the guidance of defense against AdvCF by means of adversarial training. Finally, we look into AdvCF's threat to future vision-based systems and propose some promising mentality for camera-based physical attacks.

**Authors**: Chengyin Hu, Weiwen Shi

**Abstracts**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely used in computer vision tasks like image classification, object detection and segmentation. Whereas recent studies have shown their vulnerability to manual digital perturbations or distortion in the input images. The accuracy of the networks is remarkably influenced by the data distribution of their training dataset. Scaling the raw images creates out-of-distribution data, which makes it a possible adversarial attack to fool the networks. In this work, we propose a Scaling-distortion dataset ImageNet-CS by Scaling a subset of the ImageNet Challenge dataset by different multiples. The aim of our work is to study the impact of scaled images on the performance of advanced DNNs. We perform experiments on several state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures on the proposed ImageNet-CS, and the results show a significant positive correlation between scaling size and accuracy decline. Moreover, based on ResNet50 architecture, we demonstrate some tests on the performance of recent proposed robust training techniques and strategies like Augmix, Revisiting and Normalizer Free on our proposed ImageNet-CS. Experiment results have shown that these robust training techniques can improve networks' robustness to scaling transformation.

**Authors**: Kuan Li, Yang Liu, Xiang Ao, Jianfeng Chi, Jinghua Feng, Hao Yang, Qing He

**Abstracts**: Benefiting from the message passing mechanism, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successful on flourish tasks over graph data. However, recent studies have shown that attackers can catastrophically degrade the performance of GNNs by maliciously modifying the graph structure. A straightforward solution to remedy this issue is to model the edge weights by learning a metric function between pairwise representations of two end nodes, which attempts to assign low weights to adversarial edges. The existing methods use either raw features or representations learned by supervised GNNs to model the edge weights. However, both strategies are faced with some immediate problems: raw features cannot represent various properties of nodes (e.g., structure information), and representations learned by supervised GNN may suffer from the poor performance of the classifier on the poisoned graph. We need representations that carry both feature information and as mush correct structure information as possible and are insensitive to structural perturbations. To this end, we propose an unsupervised pipeline, named STABLE, to optimize the graph structure. Finally, we input the well-refined graph into a downstream classifier. For this part, we design an advanced GCN that significantly enhances the robustness of vanilla GCN without increasing the time complexity. Extensive experiments on four real-world graph benchmarks demonstrate that STABLE outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and successfully defends against various attacks.

**Authors**: Elizabeth Coda, Brad Clymer, Chance DeSmet, Yijing Watkins, Michael Girard

**Abstracts**: A wide variety of adversarial attacks have been proposed and explored using image and audio data. These attacks are notoriously easy to generate digitally when the attacker can directly manipulate the input to a model, but are much more difficult to implement in the real-world. In this paper we present a universal, time invariant attack for general time series data such that the attack has a frequency spectrum primarily composed of the frequencies present in the original data. The universality of the attack makes it fast and easy to implement as no computation is required to add it to an input, while time invariance is useful for real-world deployment. Additionally, the frequency constraint ensures the attack can withstand filtering. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack in two different domains, speech recognition and unintended radiated emission, and show that the attack is robust against common transform-and-compare defense pipelines.



## **27. Adversarial for Social Privacy: A Poisoning Strategy to Degrade User Identity Linkage**

**Authors**: Jiangli Shao, Yongqing Wang, Boshen Shi, Hao Gao, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng

**Abstracts**: Privacy issues on social networks have been extensively discussed in recent years. The user identity linkage (UIL) task, aiming at finding corresponding users across different social networks, would be a threat to privacy if unethically applied. The sensitive user information might be detected through connected identities. A promising and novel solution to this issue is to design an adversarial strategy to degrade the matching performance of UIL models. However, most existing adversarial attacks on graphs are designed for models working in a single network, while UIL is a cross-network learning task. Meanwhile, privacy protection against UIL works unilaterally in real-world scenarios, i.e., the service provider can only add perturbations to its own network to protect its users from being linked. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel adversarial attack strategy that poisons one target network to prevent its nodes from being linked to other networks by UIL algorithms. Specifically, we reformalize the UIL problem in the perspective of kernelized topology consistency and convert the attack objective to maximizing the structural changes within the target network before and after attacks. A novel graph kernel is then defined with Earth mover's distance (EMD) on the edge-embedding space. In terms of efficiency, a fast attack strategy is proposed by greedy searching and replacing EMD with its lower bound. Results on three real-world datasets indicate that the proposed attacks can best fool a wide range of UIL models and reach a balance between attack effectiveness and imperceptibility.

**Authors**: Prince Grover, Zheng Li, Jianbo Liu, Jakub Zablocki, Hao Zhou, Julia Xu, Anqi Cheng

**Abstracts**: Standardized datasets and benchmarks have spurred innovations in computer vision, natural language processing, multi-modal and tabular settings. We note that, as compared to other well researched fields fraud detection has numerous differences. The differences include a high class imbalance, diverse feature types, frequently changing fraud patterns, and adversarial nature of the problem. Due to these differences, the modeling approaches that are designed for other classification tasks may not work well for the fraud detection. We introduce Fraud Dataset Benchmark (FDB), a compilation of publicly available datasets catered to fraud detection. FDB comprises variety of fraud related tasks, ranging from identifying fraudulent card-not-present transactions, detecting bot attacks, classifying malicious URLs, predicting risk of loan to content moderation. The Python based library from FDB provides consistent API for data loading with standardized training and testing splits. For reference, we also provide baseline evaluations of different modeling approaches on FDB. Considering the increasing popularity of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) for various research and business problems, we used AutoML frameworks for our baseline evaluations. For fraud prevention, the organizations that operate with limited resources and lack ML expertise often hire a team of investigators, use blocklists and manual rules, all of which are inefficient and do not scale well. Such organizations can benefit from AutoML solutions that are easy to deploy in production and pass the bar of fraud prevention requirements. We hope that FDB helps in the development of customized fraud detection techniques catered to different fraud modus operandi (MOs) as well as in the improvement of AutoML systems that can work well for all datasets in the benchmark.

**Authors**: Connor Dickey, Christopher Smith, Quentin Johnson, Jingcheng Li, Ziqi Xu, Loukas Lazos, Ming Li

**Abstracts**: Autonomous vehicle platooning promises many benefits such as fuel efficiency, road safety, reduced traffic congestion, and passenger comfort. Platooning vehicles travel in a single file, in close distance, and at the same velocity. The platoon formation is autonomously maintained by a Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) system which relies on sensory data and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. In fact, V2V messages play a critical role in shortening the platooning distance while maintaining safety. Whereas V2V message integrity and source authentication can be verified via cryptographic methods, establishing the truthfulness of the message contents is a much harder task.   This work establishes a physical access control mechanism to restrict V2V messages to platooning members. Specifically, we aim at tying the digital identity of a candidate requesting to join a platoon to its physical trajectory relative to the platoon. We propose the {\em Wiggle} protocol that employs a physical challenge-response exchange to prove that a candidate requesting to be admitted into a platoon actually follows it. The protocol name is inspired by the random longitudinal movements that the candidate is challenged to execute. {\em Wiggle} prevents any remote adversary from joining the platoon and injecting fake CACC messages. Compared to prior works, {\em Wiggle} is resistant to pre-recording attacks and can verify that the candidate is directly behind the verifier at the same lane.



## **30. Membership Inference Attacks by Exploiting Loss Trajectory**

cs.CR

Accepted by CCS 2022

**SubmitDate**: 2022-08-31    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.14933v1)

**Authors**: Yiyong Liu, Zhengyu Zhao, Michael Backes, Yang Zhang

**Abstracts**: Machine learning models are vulnerable to membership inference attacks in which an adversary aims to predict whether or not a particular sample was contained in the target model's training dataset. Existing attack methods have commonly exploited the output information (mostly, losses) solely from the given target model. As a result, in practical scenarios where both the member and non-member samples yield similarly small losses, these methods are naturally unable to differentiate between them. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a new attack method, called \system, which can exploit the membership information from the whole training process of the target model for improving the attack performance. To mount the attack in the common black-box setting, we leverage knowledge distillation, and represent the membership information by the losses evaluated on a sequence of intermediate models at different distillation epochs, namely \emph{distilled loss trajectory}, together with the loss from the given target model. Experimental results over different datasets and model architectures demonstrate the great advantage of our attack in terms of different metrics. For example, on CINIC-10, our attack achieves at least 6$\times$ higher true-positive rate at a low false-positive rate of 0.1\% than existing methods. Further analysis demonstrates the general effectiveness of our attack in more strict scenarios.

**Authors**: Zhiyuan He, Yijun Yang, Pin-Yu Chen, Qiang Xu, Tsung-Yi Ho

**Abstracts**: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved excellent performance in various fields. However, DNNs' vulnerability to Adversarial Examples (AE) hinders their deployments to safety-critical applications. This paper presents a novel AE detection framework, named BEYOND, for trustworthy predictions. BEYOND performs the detection by distinguishing the AE's abnormal relation with its augmented versions, i.e. neighbors, from two prospects: representation similarity and label consistency. An off-the-shelf Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) model is used to extract the representation and predict the label for its highly informative representation capacity compared to supervised learning models. For clean samples, their representations and predictions are closely consistent with their neighbors, whereas those of AEs differ greatly. Furthermore, we explain this observation and show that by leveraging this discrepancy BEYOND can effectively detect AEs. We develop a rigorous justification for the effectiveness of BEYOND. Furthermore, as a plug-and-play model, BEYOND can easily cooperate with the Adversarial Trained Classifier (ATC), achieving the state-of-the-art (SOTA) robustness accuracy. Experimental results show that BEYOND outperforms baselines by a large margin, especially under adaptive attacks. Empowered by the robust relation net built on SSL, we found that BEYOND outperforms baselines in terms of both detection ability and speed. Our code will be publicly available.

**Authors**: Bo Tu, Wen-Tai Li, Chau Yuen

**Abstracts**: This work studies the potential vulnerability of distributed control schemes in smart grids. To this end, we consider an optimal inverter VAR control problem within a PV-integrated distribution network. First, we formulate the centralized optimization problem considering the reactive power priority and further reformulate the problem into a distributed framework by an accelerated proximal projection method. The inverter controller can curtail the PV output of each user by clamping the reactive power. To illustrate the studied distributed control scheme that may be vulnerable due to the two-hop information communication pattern, we present a heuristic attack injecting false data during the information exchange. Then we analyze the attack impact on the update procedure of critical parameters. A case study with an eight-node test feeder demonstrates that adversaries can violate the constraints of distributed control scheme without being detected through simple attacks such as the proposed attack.

**Authors**: MingWei Zhou, Xiaobing Pei

**Abstracts**: Most current methods generate adversarial examples with the $L_p$ norm specification. As a result, many defense methods utilize this property to eliminate the impact of such attacking algorithms. In this paper,we instead introduce "unrestricted" perturbations that create adversarial samples by using spurious relations which were learned by model training. Specifically, we find feature clusters in non-semantic features that are strongly correlated with model judgment results, and treat them as spurious relations learned by the model. Then we create adversarial samples by using them to replace the corresponding feature clusters in the target image. Experimental evaluations show that in both black-box and white-box situations. Our adversarial examples do not change the semantics of images, while still being effective at fooling an adversarially trained DNN image classifier.

**Abstracts**: Adversarial machine learning is an emerging area showing the vulnerability of deep learning models. Exploring attack methods to challenge state of the art artificial intelligence (A.I.) models is an area of critical concern. The reliability and robustness of such A.I. models are one of the major concerns with an increasing number of effective adversarial attack methods. Classification tasks are a major vulnerable area for adversarial attacks. The majority of attack strategies are developed for colored or gray-scaled images. Consequently, adversarial attacks on binary image recognition systems have not been sufficiently studied. Binary images are simple two possible pixel-valued signals with a single channel. The simplicity of binary images has a significant advantage compared to colored and gray scaled images, namely computation efficiency. Moreover, most optical character recognition systems (O.C.R.s), such as handwritten character recognition, plate number identification, and bank check recognition systems, use binary images or binarization in their processing steps. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient attack method, Efficient Combinatorial Black-box Adversarial Attack, on binary image classifiers. We validate the efficiency of the attack technique on two different data sets and three classification networks, demonstrating its performance. Furthermore, we compare our proposed method with state-of-the-art methods regarding advantages and disadvantages as well as applicability.



## **35. Solving the Capsulation Attack against Backdoor-based Deep Neural Network Watermarks by Reversing Triggers**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2022-08-30    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.14127v1)

**Authors**: Fangqi Li, Shilin Wang, Yun Zhu

**Abstracts**: Backdoor-based watermarking schemes were proposed to protect the intellectual property of artificial intelligence models, especially deep neural networks, under the black-box setting. Compared with ordinary backdoors, backdoor-based watermarks need to digitally incorporate the owner's identity, which fact adds extra requirements to the trigger generation and verification programs. Moreover, these concerns produce additional security risks after the watermarking scheme has been published for as a forensics tool or the owner's evidence has been eavesdropped on. This paper proposes the capsulation attack, an efficient method that can invalidate most established backdoor-based watermarking schemes without sacrificing the pirated model's functionality. By encapsulating the deep neural network with a rule-based or Bayes filter, an adversary can block ownership probing and reject the ownership verification. We propose a metric, CAScore, to measure a backdoor-based watermarking scheme's security against the capsulation attack. This paper also proposes a new backdoor-based deep neural network watermarking scheme that is secure against the capsulation attack by reversing the encoding process and randomizing the exposure of triggers.

**Authors**: Loris Giulivi, Malhar Jere, Loris Rossi, Farinaz Koushanfar, Gabriela Ciocarlie, Briland Hitaj, Giacomo Boracchi

**Abstracts**: A growing body of work has shown that deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial examples. These take the form of small perturbations applied to the model's input which lead to incorrect predictions. Unfortunately, most literature focuses on visually imperceivable perturbations to be applied to digital images that often are, by design, impossible to be deployed to physical targets. We present Adversarial Scratches: a novel L0 black-box attack, which takes the form of scratches in images, and which possesses much greater deployability than other state-of-the-art attacks. Adversarial Scratches leverage B\'ezier Curves to reduce the dimension of the search space and possibly constrain the attack to a specific location. We test Adversarial Scratches in several scenarios, including a publicly available API and images of traffic signs. Results show that, often, our attack achieves higher fooling rate than other deployable state-of-the-art methods, while requiring significantly fewer queries and modifying very few pixels.

**Authors**: Jie Zhang, Lei Zhang, Gang Li, Chao Wu

**Abstracts**: Adversarial examples are inputs for machine learning models that have been designed by attackers to cause the model to make mistakes. In this paper, we demonstrate that adversarial examples can also be utilized for good to improve the performance of imbalanced learning. We provide a new perspective on how to deal with imbalanced data: adjust the biased decision boundary by training with Guiding Adversarial Examples (GAEs). Our method can effectively increase the accuracy of minority classes while sacrificing little accuracy on majority classes. We empirically show, on several benchmark datasets, our proposed method is comparable to the state-of-the-art method. To our best knowledge, we are the first to deal with imbalanced learning with adversarial examples.

**Authors**: Zayd Hammoudeh, Daniel Lowd

**Abstracts**: Adversarial training instances can severely distort a model's behavior. This work investigates certified regression defenses, which provide guaranteed limits on how much a regressor's prediction may change under a training-set attack. Our key insight is that certified regression reduces to certified classification when using median as a model's primary decision function. Coupling our reduction with existing certified classifiers, we propose six new provably-robust regressors. To the extent of our knowledge, this is the first work that certifies the robustness of individual regression predictions without any assumptions about the data distribution and model architecture. We also show that existing state-of-the-art certified classifiers often make overly-pessimistic assumptions that can degrade their provable guarantees. We introduce a tighter analysis of model robustness, which in many cases results in significantly improved certified guarantees. Lastly, we empirically demonstrate our approaches' effectiveness on both regression and classification data, where the accuracy of up to 50% of test predictions can be guaranteed under 1% training-set corruption and up to 30% of predictions under 4% corruption. Our source code is available at https://github.com/ZaydH/certified-regression.

**Abstracts**: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm where an autonomous agent learns to make an optimal sequence of decisions by interacting with the underlying environment. The promise demonstrated by RL-guided workflows in unraveling electronic design automation problems has encouraged hardware security researchers to utilize autonomous RL agents in solving domain-specific problems. From the perspective of hardware security, such autonomous agents are appealing as they can generate optimal actions in an unknown adversarial environment. On the other hand, the continued globalization of the integrated circuit supply chain has forced chip fabrication to off-shore, untrustworthy entities, leading to increased concerns about the security of the hardware. Furthermore, the unknown adversarial environment and increasing design complexity make it challenging for defenders to detect subtle modifications made by attackers (a.k.a. hardware Trojans). In this brief, we outline the development of RL agents in detecting hardware Trojans, one of the most challenging hardware security problems. Additionally, we outline potential opportunities and enlist the challenges of applying RL to solve hardware security problems.

**Authors**: Dvij Kalaria, Aritra Hazra, Partha Pratim Chakrabarti

**Abstracts**: With the rapid advancement and increased use of deep learning models in image identification, security becomes a major concern to their deployment in safety-critical systems. Since the accuracy and robustness of deep learning models are primarily attributed from the purity of the training samples, therefore the deep learning architectures are often susceptible to adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks are often obtained by making subtle perturbations to normal images, which are mostly imperceptible to humans, but can seriously confuse the state-of-the-art machine learning models. We propose a framework, named APuDAE, leveraging Denoising AutoEncoders (DAEs) to purify these samples by using them in an adaptive way and thus improve the classification accuracy of the target classifier networks that have been attacked. We also show how using DAEs adaptively instead of using them directly, improves classification accuracy further and is more robust to the possibility of designing adaptive attacks to fool them. We demonstrate our results over MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet dataset and show how our framework (APuDAE) provides comparable and in most cases better performance to the baseline methods in purifying adversaries. We also design adaptive attack specifically designed to attack our purifying model and demonstrate how our defense is robust to that.

**Authors**: Zhendong Wang, Xiaoming Zeng, Xulong Tang, Danfeng Zhang, Xing Hu, Yang Hu

**Abstracts**: The deep neural network (DNN) models are deemed confidential due to their unique value in expensive training efforts, privacy-sensitive training data, and proprietary network characteristics. Consequently, the model value raises incentive for adversary to steal the model for profits, such as the representative model extraction attack. Emerging attack can leverage timing-sensitive architecture-level events (i.e., Arch-hints) disclosed in hardware platforms to extract DNN model layer information accurately. In this paper, we take the first step to uncover the root cause of such Arch-hints and summarize the principles to identify them. We then apply these principles to emerging Unified Memory (UM) management system and identify three new Arch-hints caused by UM's unique data movement patterns. We then develop a new extraction attack, UMProbe. We also create the first DNN benchmark suite in UM and utilize the benchmark suite to evaluate UMProbe. Our evaluation shows that UMProbe can extract the layer sequence with an accuracy of 95% for almost all victim test models, which thus calls for more attention to the DNN security in UM system.

**Authors**: Anshuka Rangi, Haifeng Xu, Long Tran-Thanh, Massimo Franceschetti

**Abstracts**: To understand the security threats to reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, this paper studies poisoning attacks to manipulate \emph{any} order-optimal learning algorithm towards a targeted policy in episodic RL and examines the potential damage of two natural types of poisoning attacks, i.e., the manipulation of \emph{reward} and \emph{action}. We discover that the effect of attacks crucially depend on whether the rewards are bounded or unbounded. In bounded reward settings, we show that only reward manipulation or only action manipulation cannot guarantee a successful attack. However, by combining reward and action manipulation, the adversary can manipulate any order-optimal learning algorithm to follow any targeted policy with $\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{T})$ total attack cost, which is order-optimal, without any knowledge of the underlying MDP. In contrast, in unbounded reward settings, we show that reward manipulation attacks are sufficient for an adversary to successfully manipulate any order-optimal learning algorithm to follow any targeted policy using $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ amount of contamination. Our results reveal useful insights about what can or cannot be achieved by poisoning attacks, and are set to spur more works on the design of robust RL algorithms.

**Authors**: Shiwen Ni, Jiawen Li, Hung-Yu Kao

**Abstracts**: With the development of social media, social communication has changed. While this facilitates people's communication and access to information, it also provides an ideal platform for spreading rumors. In normal or critical situations, rumors will affect people's judgment and even endanger social security. However, natural language is high-dimensional and sparse, and the same rumor may be expressed in hundreds of ways on social media. As such, the robustness and generalization of the current rumor detection model are put into question. We proposed a novel \textbf{h}ierarchical \textbf{a}dversarial \textbf{t}raining method for \textbf{r}umor \textbf{d}etection (HAT4RD) on social media. Specifically, HAT4RD is based on gradient ascent by adding adversarial perturbations to the embedding layers of post-level and event-level modules to deceive the detector. At the same time, the detector uses stochastic gradient descent to minimize the adversarial risk to learn a more robust model. In this way, the post-level and event-level sample spaces are enhanced, and we have verified the robustness of our model under a variety of adversarial attacks. Moreover, visual experiments indicate that the proposed model drifts into an area with a flat loss landscape, leading to better generalization. We evaluate our proposed method on three public rumors datasets from two commonly used social platforms (Twitter and Weibo). Experiment results demonstrate that our model achieves better results than state-of-the-art methods.

**Authors**: Faqiang Liu, Rong Zhao

**Abstracts**: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable performance in various applications but are extremely vulnerable to adversarial perturbation. The most representative and promising methods that can enhance model robustness, such as adversarial training and its variants, substantially degrade model accuracy on benign samples, limiting practical utility. Although incorporating extra training data can alleviate the trade-off to a certain extent, it remains unsolved to achieve both robustness and accuracy under limited training data. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of overcoming the trade-off, by developing an adversarial feature stacking (AFS) model, which combines multiple independent feature extractors with varied levels of robustness and accuracy. Theoretical analysis is further conducted, and general principles for the selection of basic feature extractors are provided. We evaluate the AFS model on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets with strong adaptive attack methods, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in terms of the trade-off. The AFS model achieves a benign accuracy improvement of ~6% on CIFAR-10 and ~10% on CIFAR-100 with comparable or even stronger robustness than the state-of-the-art adversarial training methods.

**Abstracts**: CountSketch and Feature Hashing (the "hashing trick") are popular randomized dimensionality reduction methods that support recovery of $\ell_2$-heavy hitters (keys $i$ where $v_i^2 > \epsilon \|\boldsymbol{v}\|_2^2$) and approximate inner products. When the inputs are {\em not adaptive} (do not depend on prior outputs), classic estimators applied to a sketch of size $O(\ell/\epsilon)$ are accurate for a number of queries that is exponential in $\ell$. When inputs are adaptive, however, an adversarial input can be constructed after $O(\ell)$ queries with the classic estimator and the best known robust estimator only supports $\tilde{O}(\ell^2)$ queries. In this work we show that this quadratic dependence is in a sense inherent: We design an attack that after $O(\ell^2)$ queries produces an adversarial input vector whose sketch is highly biased. Our attack uses "natural" non-adaptive inputs (only the final adversarial input is chosen adaptively) and universally applies with any correct estimator, including one that is unknown to the attacker. In that, we expose inherent vulnerability of this fundamental method.

Extended version of arXiv:2105.05949 which appeared in FoSSaCS 2022

**SubmitDate**: 2022-08-28    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.13232v1)

**Authors**: Anne Broadbent, Martti Karvonen

**Abstracts**: We formalize the simulation paradigm of cryptography in terms of category theory and show that protocols secure against abstract attacks form a symmetric monoidal category, thus giving an abstract model of composable security definitions in cryptography. Our model is able to incorporate computational security, set-up assumptions and various attack models such as colluding or independently acting subsets of adversaries in a modular, flexible fashion. W We conclude by using string diagrams to rederive the security of the one-time pad and no-go results concerning the limits of bipartite and tripartite cryptography, ruling out e.g., composable commitments and broadcasting. On the way, we exhibit two categorical constructions of resource theories that might be of independent interest: one capturing resources shared among multiple parties and one capturing resource conversions that succeed asymptotically.

**Abstracts**: Deep learning models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples that are elaborately designed for malicious purposes and are imperceptible to the human perceptual system. Autoencoder, when trained solely over benign examples, has been widely used for (self-supervised) adversarial detection based on the assumption that adversarial examples yield larger reconstruction errors. However, because lacking adversarial examples in its training and the too strong generalization ability of autoencoder, this assumption does not always hold true in practice. To alleviate this problem, we explore how to detect adversarial examples with disentangled label/semantic features under the autoencoder structure. Specifically, we propose Disentangled Representation-based Reconstruction (DRR). In DRR, we train an autoencoder over both correctly paired label/semantic features and incorrectly paired label/semantic features to reconstruct benign and counterexamples. This mimics the behavior of adversarial examples and can reduce the unnecessary generalization ability of autoencoder. We compare our method with the state-of-the-art self-supervised detection methods under different adversarial attacks and different victim models, and it exhibits better performance in various metrics (area under the ROC curve, true positive rate, and true negative rate) for most attack settings. Though DRR is initially designed for visual tasks only, we demonstrate that it can be easily extended for natural language tasks as well. Notably, different from other autoencoder-based detectors, our method can provide resistance to the adaptive adversary.

**Abstracts**: Fine-tuning can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing works about black-box attacks on fine-tuned models (BAFT) are limited by strong assumptions. To fill the gap, we propose two novel BAFT settings, cross-domain and cross-domain cross-architecture BAFT, which only assume that (1) the target model for attacking is a fine-tuned model, and (2) the source domain data is known and accessible. To successfully attack fine-tuned models under both settings, we propose to first train an adversarial generator against the source model, which adopts an encoder-decoder architecture and maps a clean input to an adversarial example. Then we search in the low-dimensional latent space produced by the encoder of the adversarial generator. The search is conducted under the guidance of the surrogate gradient obtained from the source model. Experimental results on different domains and different network architectures demonstrate that the proposed attack method can effectively and efficiently attack the fine-tuned models.

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2022-08-28    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.14225v1)

**Authors**: Tawfiq M. Aljohani

**Abstracts**: Recent high-profile cyberattacks on energy infrastructures, such as the security breach of the Colonial Pipeline in 2021 and attacks that have disrupted Ukraine's power grid from the mid-2010s till date, have pushed cybersecurity as a top priority. As political tensions have escalated in Europe this year, concerns about critical infrastructure security have increased. Operators in the industrial sector face new cybersecurity threats that increase the risk of disruptions in services, property damages, and environmental harm. Amid rising geopolitical tensions, industrial companies, with their network-connected systems, are now considered major targets for adversaries to advance political, social, or military agendas. Moreover, the recent Russian-Ukrainian conflict has set the alarm worldwide about the danger of targeting energy grids via cyberattacks. Attack methodologies, techniques, and procedures used successfully to hack energy grids in Ukraine can be used elsewhere. This work aims to present a thorough analysis of the cybersecurity of the energy infrastructure amid the increased rise of cyberwars. The article navigates through the recent history of energy-related cyberattacks and their reasoning, discusses the grid's vulnerability, and makes a precautionary argument for securing the grids against them.
