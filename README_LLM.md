cs.CR

This work has been accepted by CCS 2024

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-26    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15469v3) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.15469v3)

**Authors**: Xiaoyi Chen, Siyuan Tang, Rui Zhu, Shijun Yan, Lei Jin, Zihao Wang, Liya Su, Zhikun Zhang, XiaoFeng Wang, Haixu Tang

**Abstract**: The rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs) have raised public concerns about the privacy leakage of personally identifiable information (PII) within their extensive training datasets. Recent studies have demonstrated that an adversary could extract highly sensitive privacy data from the training data of LLMs with carefully designed prompts. However, these attacks suffer from the model's tendency to hallucinate and catastrophic forgetting (CF) in the pre-training stage, rendering the veracity of divulged PIIs negligible. In our research, we propose a novel attack, Janus, which exploits the fine-tuning interface to recover forgotten PIIs from the pre-training data in LLMs. We formalize the privacy leakage problem in LLMs and explain why forgotten PIIs can be recovered through empirical analysis on open-source language models. Based upon these insights, we evaluate the performance of Janus on both open-source language models and two latest LLMs, i.e., GPT-3.5-Turbo and LLaMA-2-7b. Our experiment results show that Janus amplifies the privacy risks by over 10 times in comparison with the baseline and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art privacy extraction attacks including prefix attacks and in-context learning (ICL). Furthermore, our analysis validates that existing fine-tuning APIs provided by OpenAI and Azure AI Studio are susceptible to our Janus attack, allowing an adversary to conduct such an attack at a low cost.

cs.CV

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-26    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18849v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.18849v2)

**Authors**: Jie Zhang, Zhongqi Wang, Mengqi Lei, Zheng Yuan, Bei Yan, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen

**Abstract**: Currently many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate the perception ability of the Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, most benchmarks conduct questions by selecting images from existing datasets, resulting in the potential data leakage. Besides, these benchmarks merely focus on evaluating LVLMs on the realistic style images and clean scenarios, leaving the multi-stylized images and noisy scenarios unexplored. In response to these challenges, we propose a dynamic and scalable benchmark named Dysca for evaluating LVLMs by leveraging synthesis images. Specifically, we leverage Stable Diffusion and design a rule-based method to dynamically generate novel images, questions and the corresponding answers. We consider 51 kinds of image styles and evaluate the perception capability in 20 subtasks. Moreover, we conduct evaluations under 4 scenarios (i.e., Clean, Corruption, Print Attacking and Adversarial Attacking) and 3 question types (i.e., Multi-choices, True-or-false and Free-form). Thanks to the generative paradigm, Dysca serves as a scalable benchmark for easily adding new subtasks and scenarios. A total of 8 advanced open-source LVLMs with 10 checkpoints are evaluated on Dysca, revealing the drawbacks of current LVLMs. The benchmark is released in \url{https://github.com/Benchmark-Dysca/Dysca}.

cs.LG

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-26    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18462v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18462v1)

**Authors**: Wissal Hamhoum, Soumaya Cherkaoui

**Abstract**: Vehicular networks are exposed to various threats resulting from malicious attacks. These threats compromise the security and reliability of communications among road users, thereby jeopardizing road and traffic safety. One of the main vectors of these attacks within vehicular networks is misbehaving vehicles. To address this challenge, we propose deploying a pretrained Large Language Model (LLM)-empowered Misbehavior Detection System (MDS) within an edge-cloud detection framework. Specifically, we fine-tune Mistral-7B, a state-of-the-art LLM, as the edge component to enable real-time detection, whereas a larger LLM deployed in the cloud can conduct a more comprehensive analysis. Our experiments conducted on the extended VeReMi dataset demonstrate Mistral-7B's superior performance, achieving 98\% accuracy compared to other LLMs such as LLAMA2-7B and RoBERTa. Additionally, we investigate the impact of window size on computational costs to optimize deployment efficiency. Leveraging LLMs in MDS shows interesting results in improving the detection of vehicle misbehavior, consequently strengthening vehicular network security to ensure the safety of road users.



## **4. SafeDecoding: Defending against Jailbreak Attacks via Safety-Aware Decoding**

cs.CR

To appear in ACL 2024

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-25    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08983v4) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08983v4)

**Authors**: Zhangchen Xu, Fengqing Jiang, Luyao Niu, Jinyuan Jia, Bill Yuchen Lin, Radha Poovendran

**Abstract**: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world applications such as code generation and chatbot assistance, extensive efforts have been made to align LLM behavior with human values, including safety. Jailbreak attacks, aiming to provoke unintended and unsafe behaviors from LLMs, remain a significant/leading LLM safety threat. In this paper, we aim to defend LLMs against jailbreak attacks by introducing SafeDecoding, a safety-aware decoding strategy for LLMs to generate helpful and harmless responses to user queries. Our insight in developing SafeDecoding is based on the observation that, even though probabilities of tokens representing harmful contents outweigh those representing harmless responses, safety disclaimers still appear among the top tokens after sorting tokens by probability in descending order. This allows us to mitigate jailbreak attacks by identifying safety disclaimers and amplifying their token probabilities, while simultaneously attenuating the probabilities of token sequences that are aligned with the objectives of jailbreak attacks. We perform extensive experiments on five LLMs using six state-of-the-art jailbreak attacks and four benchmark datasets. Our results show that SafeDecoding significantly reduces the attack success rate and harmfulness of jailbreak attacks without compromising the helpfulness of responses to benign user queries. SafeDecoding outperforms six defense methods.



## **5. Human-Interpretable Adversarial Prompt Attack on Large Language Models with Situational Context**

cs.CL

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-25    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14644v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14644v2)

**Authors**: Nilanjana Das, Edward Raff, Manas Gaur

**Abstract**: Previous research on testing the vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) using adversarial attacks has primarily focused on nonsensical prompt injections, which are easily detected upon manual or automated review (e.g., via byte entropy). However, the exploration of innocuous human-understandable malicious prompts augmented with adversarial injections remains limited. In this research, we explore converting a nonsensical suffix attack into a sensible prompt via a situation-driven contextual re-writing. This allows us to show suffix conversion without any gradients, using only LLMs to perform the attacks, and thus better understand the scope of possible risks. We combine an independent, meaningful adversarial insertion and situations derived from movies to check if this can trick an LLM. The situations are extracted from the IMDB dataset, and prompts are defined following a few-shot chain-of-thought prompting. Our approach demonstrates that a successful situation-driven attack can be executed on both open-source and proprietary LLMs. We find that across many LLMs, as few as 1 attempt produces an attack and that these attacks transfer between LLMs.



## **6. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde: Two Faces of LLMs**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-25    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03853v4) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.03853v4)

**Authors**: Matteo Gioele Collu, Tom Janssen-Groesbeek, Stefanos Koffas, Mauro Conti, Stjepan Picek

**Abstract**: Recently, we have witnessed a rise in the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in applications like chatbot assistants. Safety mechanisms and specialized training procedures are implemented to prevent improper responses from these assistants. In this work, we bypass these measures for ChatGPT and Gemini (and, to some extent, Bing chat) by making them impersonate complex personas with personality characteristics that are not aligned with a truthful assistant. We start by creating elaborate biographies of these personas, which we then use in a new session with the same chatbots. Our conversations then follow a role-play style to elicit prohibited responses. Using personas, we show that prohibited responses are actually provided, making it possible to obtain unauthorized, illegal, or harmful information. This work shows that by using adversarial personas, one can overcome safety mechanisms set out by ChatGPT and Gemini. We also introduce several ways of activating such adversarial personas, which show that both chatbots are vulnerable to this kind of attack. With the same principle, we introduce two defenses that push the model to interpret trustworthy personalities and make it more robust against such attacks.



## **7. The Dark Side of Function Calling: Pathways to Jailbreaking Large Language Models**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-25    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17915v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17915v1)

**Authors**: Zihui Wu, Haichang Gao, Jianping He, Ping Wang

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their power comes with significant security considerations. While extensive research has been conducted on the safety of LLMs in chat mode, the security implications of their function calling feature have been largely overlooked. This paper uncovers a critical vulnerability in the function calling process of LLMs, introducing a novel "jailbreak function" attack method that exploits alignment discrepancies, user coercion, and the absence of rigorous safety filters. Our empirical study, conducted on six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-pro, reveals an alarming average success rate of over 90\% for this attack. We provide a comprehensive analysis of why function calls are susceptible to such attacks and propose defensive strategies, including the use of defensive prompts. Our findings highlight the urgent need for enhanced security measures in the function calling capabilities of LLMs, contributing to the field of AI safety by identifying a previously unexplored risk, designing an effective attack method, and suggesting practical defensive measures.

## **8. PenHeal: A Two-Stage LLM Framework for Automated Pentesting and Optimal Remediation**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-25    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17788v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17788v1)

**Authors**: Junjie Huang, Quanyan Zhu

**Abstract**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in enhancing cybersecurity defenses against sophisticated threats. LLM-based penetration testing is an essential step in automating system security evaluations by identifying vulnerabilities. Remediation, the subsequent crucial step, addresses these discovered vulnerabilities. Since details about vulnerabilities, exploitation methods, and software versions offer crucial insights into system weaknesses, integrating penetration testing with vulnerability remediation into a cohesive system has become both intuitive and necessary.   This paper introduces PenHeal, a two-stage LLM-based framework designed to autonomously identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities. The framework integrates two LLM-enabled components: the Pentest Module, which detects multiple vulnerabilities within a system, and the Remediation Module, which recommends optimal remediation strategies. The integration is facilitated through Counterfactual Prompting and an Instructor module that guides the LLMs using external knowledge to explore multiple potential attack paths effectively. Our experimental results demonstrate that PenHeal not only automates the identification and remediation of vulnerabilities but also significantly improves vulnerability coverage by 31%, increases the effectiveness of remediation strategies by 32%, and reduces the associated costs by 46% compared to baseline models. These outcomes highlight the transformative potential of LLMs in reshaping cybersecurity practices, offering an innovative solution to defend against cyber threats.



## **9. Towards Neural Network based Cognitive Models of Dynamic Decision-Making by Humans**

cs.LG

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-24    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17622v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17622v1)

**Authors**: Changyu Chen, Shashank Reddy Chirra, Maria José Ferreira, Cleotilde Gonzalez, Arunesh Sinha, Pradeep Varakantham

**Abstract**: Modelling human cognitive processes in dynamic decision-making tasks has been an endeavor in AI for a long time. Some initial works have attempted to utilize neural networks (and large language models) but often assume one common model for all humans and aim to emulate human behavior in aggregate. However, behavior of each human is distinct, heterogeneous and relies on specific past experiences in specific tasks. To that end, we build on a well known model of cognition, namely Instance Based Learning (IBL), that posits that decisions are made based on similar situations encountered in the past. We propose two new attention based neural network models to model human decision-making in dynamic settings. We experiment with two distinct datasets gathered from human subject experiment data, one focusing on detection of phishing email by humans and another where humans act as attackers in a cybersecurity setting and decide on an attack option. We conduct extensive experiments with our two neural network models, IBL, and GPT3.5, and demonstrate that one of our neural network models achieves the best performance in representing human decision-making. We find an interesting trend that all models predict a human's decision better if that human is better at the task. We also explore explanation of human decisions based on what our model considers important in prediction. Overall, our work yields promising results for further use of neural networks in cognitive modelling of human decision making. Our code is available at https://github.com/shshnkreddy/NCM-HDM.



## **10. Can Watermarking Large Language Models Prevent Copyrighted Text Generation and Hide Training Data?**

cs.LG

21 pages, 6 figures

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-24    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17417v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17417v1)

**Authors**: Michael-Andrei Panaitescu-Liess, Zora Che, Bang An, Yuancheng Xu, Pankayaraj Pathmanathan, Souradip Chakraborty, Sicheng Zhu, Tom Goldstein, Furong Huang

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating diverse and contextually rich text. However, concerns regarding copyright infringement arise as LLMs may inadvertently produce copyrighted material. In this paper, we first investigate the effectiveness of watermarking LLMs as a deterrent against the generation of copyrighted texts. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that incorporating watermarks into LLMs significantly reduces the likelihood of generating copyrighted content, thereby addressing a critical concern in the deployment of LLMs. Additionally, we explore the impact of watermarking on Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which aim to discern whether a sample was part of the pretraining dataset and may be used to detect copyright violations. Surprisingly, we find that watermarking adversely affects the success rate of MIAs, complicating the task of detecting copyrighted text in the pretraining dataset. Finally, we propose an adaptive technique to improve the success rate of a recent MIA under watermarking. Our findings underscore the importance of developing adaptive methods to study critical problems in LLMs with potential legal implications.

version 0.1 (added missing refs)

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-24    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15847v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15847v2)

**Authors**: Dario Pasquini, Evgenios M. Kornaropoulos, Giuseppe Ateniese

**Abstract**: We introduce LLMmap, a first-generation fingerprinting attack targeted at LLM-integrated applications. LLMmap employs an active fingerprinting approach, sending carefully crafted queries to the application and analyzing the responses to identify the specific LLM model in use. With as few as 8 interactions, LLMmap can accurately identify LLMs with over 95% accuracy. More importantly, LLMmap is designed to be robust across different application layers, allowing it to identify LLMs operating under various system prompts, stochastic sampling hyperparameters, and even complex generation frameworks such as RAG or Chain-of-Thought.



## **12. From Sands to Mansions: Enabling Automatic Full-Life-Cycle Cyberattack Construction with LLM**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-24    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16928v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16928v1)

**Authors**: Lingzhi Wang, Jiahui Wang, Kyle Jung, Kedar Thiagarajan, Emily Wei, Xiangmin Shen, Yan Chen, Zhenyuan Li

**Abstract**: The escalating battles between attackers and defenders in cybersecurity make it imperative to test and evaluate defense capabilities from the attackers' perspective. However, constructing full-life-cycle cyberattacks and performing red team emulations requires significant time and domain knowledge from security experts. Existing cyberattack simulation frameworks face challenges such as limited technical coverage, inability to conduct full-life-cycle attacks, and the need for manual infrastructure building. These limitations hinder the quality and diversity of the constructed attacks. In this paper, we leveraged the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in summarizing knowledge from existing attack intelligence and generating executable machine code based on human knowledge. we proposed AURORA, an automatic end-to-end cyberattack construction and emulation framework. AURORA can autonomously build multi-stage cyberattack plans based on Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports, construct the emulation infrastructures, and execute the attack procedures. We also developed an attack procedure knowledge graph to integrate knowledge about attack techniques throughout the full life cycle of advanced cyberattacks from various sources. We constructed and evaluated more than 20 full-life-cycle cyberattacks based on existing CTI reports. Compared to previous attack simulation frameworks, AURORA can construct multi-step attacks and the infrastructures in several minutes without human intervention. Furthermore, AURORA incorporates a wider range (40% more) of attack techniques into the constructed attacks in a more efficient way than the professional red teams. To benefit further research, we open-sourced the dataset containing the execution files and infrastructures of 20 emulated cyberattacks.



## **13. RigorLLM: Resilient Guardrails for Large Language Models against Undesired Content**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-23    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13031v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13031v2)

**Authors**: Zhuowen Yuan, Zidi Xiong, Yi Zeng, Ning Yu, Ruoxi Jia, Dawn Song, Bo Li

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities across various tasks in different domains. However, the emergence of biases and the potential for generating harmful content in LLMs, particularly under malicious inputs, pose significant challenges. Current mitigation strategies, while effective, are not resilient under adversarial attacks. This paper introduces Resilient Guardrails for Large Language Models (RigorLLM), a novel framework designed to efficiently and effectively moderate harmful and unsafe inputs and outputs for LLMs. By employing a multi-faceted approach that includes energy-based training data augmentation through Langevin dynamics, optimizing a safe suffix for inputs via minimax optimization, and integrating a fusion-based model combining robust KNN with LLMs based on our data augmentation, RigorLLM offers a robust solution to harmful content moderation. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that RigorLLM not only outperforms existing baselines like OpenAI API and Perspective API in detecting harmful content but also exhibits unparalleled resilience to jailbreaking attacks. The innovative use of constrained optimization and a fusion-based guardrail approach represents a significant step forward in developing more secure and reliable LLMs, setting a new standard for content moderation frameworks in the face of evolving digital threats.



## **14. Watermarks in the Sand: Impossibility of Strong Watermarking for Generative Models**

cs.LG

ICML 2024. Website: https://hanlin-zhang.com/impossibility-watermarks

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-23    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04378v4) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.04378v4)

**Authors**: Hanlin Zhang, Benjamin L. Edelman, Danilo Francati, Daniele Venturi, Giuseppe Ateniese, Boaz Barak

**Abstract**: Watermarking generative models consists of planting a statistical signal (watermark) in a model's output so that it can be later verified that the output was generated by the given model. A strong watermarking scheme satisfies the property that a computationally bounded attacker cannot erase the watermark without causing significant quality degradation. In this paper, we study the (im)possibility of strong watermarking schemes. We prove that, under well-specified and natural assumptions, strong watermarking is impossible to achieve. This holds even in the private detection algorithm setting, where the watermark insertion and detection algorithms share a secret key, unknown to the attacker. To prove this result, we introduce a generic efficient watermark attack; the attacker is not required to know the private key of the scheme or even which scheme is used. Our attack is based on two assumptions: (1) The attacker has access to a "quality oracle" that can evaluate whether a candidate output is a high-quality response to a prompt, and (2) The attacker has access to a "perturbation oracle" which can modify an output with a nontrivial probability of maintaining quality, and which induces an efficiently mixing random walk on high-quality outputs. We argue that both assumptions can be satisfied in practice by an attacker with weaker computational capabilities than the watermarked model itself, to which the attacker has only black-box access. Furthermore, our assumptions will likely only be easier to satisfy over time as models grow in capabilities and modalities. We demonstrate the feasibility of our attack by instantiating it to attack three existing watermarking schemes for large language models: Kirchenbauer et al. (2023), Kuditipudi et al. (2023), and Zhao et al. (2023). The same attack successfully removes the watermarks planted by all three schemes, with only minor quality degradation.



## **15. Can Large Language Models Automatically Jailbreak GPT-4V?**

cs.CL

TrustNLP@NAACL2024 (Fourth Workshop on Trustworthy Natural Language  Processing)

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-23    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16686v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16686v1)

**Authors**: Yuanwei Wu, Yue Huang, Yixin Liu, Xiang Li, Pan Zhou, Lichao Sun

**Abstract**: GPT-4V has attracted considerable attention due to its extraordinary capacity for integrating and processing multimodal information. At the same time, its ability of face recognition raises new safety concerns of privacy leakage. Despite researchers' efforts in safety alignment through RLHF or preprocessing filters, vulnerabilities might still be exploited. In our study, we introduce AutoJailbreak, an innovative automatic jailbreak technique inspired by prompt optimization. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for red-teaming to refine the jailbreak prompt and employ weak-to-strong in-context learning prompts to boost efficiency. Furthermore, we present an effective search method that incorporates early stopping to minimize optimization time and token expenditure. Our experiments demonstrate that AutoJailbreak significantly surpasses conventional methods, achieving an Attack Success Rate (ASR) exceeding 95.3\%. This research sheds light on strengthening GPT-4V security, underscoring the potential for LLMs to be exploited in compromising GPT-4V integrity.



## **16. RedAgent: Red Teaming Large Language Models with Context-aware Autonomous Language Agent**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-23    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16667v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16667v1)

**Authors**: Huiyu Xu, Wenhui Zhang, Zhibo Wang, Feng Xiao, Rui Zheng, Yunhe Feng, Zhongjie Ba, Kui Ren

**Abstract**: Recently, advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have been integrated into many real-world applications like Code Copilot. These applications have significantly expanded the attack surface of LLMs, exposing them to a variety of threats. Among them, jailbreak attacks that induce toxic responses through jailbreak prompts have raised critical safety concerns. To identify these threats, a growing number of red teaming approaches simulate potential adversarial scenarios by crafting jailbreak prompts to test the target LLM. However, existing red teaming methods do not consider the unique vulnerabilities of LLM in different scenarios, making it difficult to adjust the jailbreak prompts to find context-specific vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, these methods are limited to refining jailbreak templates using a few mutation operations, lacking the automation and scalability to adapt to different scenarios. To enable context-aware and efficient red teaming, we abstract and model existing attacks into a coherent concept called "jailbreak strategy" and propose a multi-agent LLM system named RedAgent that leverages these strategies to generate context-aware jailbreak prompts. By self-reflecting on contextual feedback in an additional memory buffer, RedAgent continuously learns how to leverage these strategies to achieve effective jailbreaks in specific contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system can jailbreak most black-box LLMs in just five queries, improving the efficiency of existing red teaming methods by two times. Additionally, RedAgent can jailbreak customized LLM applications more efficiently. By generating context-aware jailbreak prompts towards applications on GPTs, we discover 60 severe vulnerabilities of these real-world applications with only two queries per vulnerability. We have reported all found issues and communicated with OpenAI and Meta for bug fixes.

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-23    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16637v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16637v1)

**Authors**: Rongwu Xu, Yishuo Cai, Zhenhong Zhou, Renjie Gu, Haiqin Weng, Yan Liu, Tianwei Zhang, Wei Xu, Han Qiu

**Abstract**: The risk of harmful content generated by large language models (LLMs) becomes a critical concern. This paper presents a systematic study on assessing and improving LLMs' capability to perform the task of \textbf{course-correction}, \ie, the model can steer away from generating harmful content autonomously. To start with, we introduce the \textsc{C$^2$-Eval} benchmark for quantitative assessment and analyze 10 popular LLMs, revealing varying proficiency of current safety-tuned LLMs in course-correction. To improve, we propose fine-tuning LLMs with preference learning, emphasizing the preference for timely course-correction. Using an automated pipeline, we create \textsc{C$^2$-Syn}, a synthetic dataset with 750K pairwise preferences, to teach models the concept of timely course-correction through data-driven preference learning. Experiments on 2 LLMs, \textsc{Llama2-Chat 7B} and \textsc{Qwen2 7B}, show that our method effectively enhances course-correction skills without affecting general performance. Additionally, it effectively improves LLMs' safety, particularly in resisting jailbreak attacks.



## **18. Defending Our Privacy With Backdoors**

cs.LG

Accepted at ECAI 2024

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-23    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08320v4) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08320v4)

**Authors**: Dominik Hintersdorf, Lukas Struppek, Daniel Neider, Kristian Kersting

**Abstract**: The proliferation of large AI models trained on uncurated, often sensitive web-scraped data has raised significant privacy concerns. One of the concerns is that adversaries can extract information about the training data using privacy attacks. Unfortunately, the task of removing specific information from the models without sacrificing performance is not straightforward and has proven to be challenging. We propose a rather easy yet effective defense based on backdoor attacks to remove private information, such as names and faces of individuals, from vision-language models by fine-tuning them for only a few minutes instead of re-training them from scratch. Specifically, by strategically inserting backdoors into text encoders, we align the embeddings of sensitive phrases with those of neutral terms-"a person" instead of the person's actual name. For image encoders, we map individuals' embeddings to be removed from the model to a universal, anonymous embedding. The results of our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of our backdoor-based defense on CLIP by assessing its performance using a specialized privacy attack for zero-shot classifiers. Our approach provides a new "dual-use" perspective on backdoor attacks and presents a promising avenue to enhance the privacy of individuals within models trained on uncurated web-scraped data.



## **19. Efficient Generation of Targeted and Transferable Adversarial Examples for Vision-Language Models Via Diffusion Models**

cs.CV

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-23    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10335v3) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10335v3)

**Authors**: Qi Guo, Shanmin Pang, Xiaojun Jia, Yang Liu, Qing Guo

**Abstract**: Adversarial attacks, particularly \textbf{targeted} transfer-based attacks, can be used to assess the adversarial robustness of large visual-language models (VLMs), allowing for a more thorough examination of potential security flaws before deployment. However, previous transfer-based adversarial attacks incur high costs due to high iteration counts and complex method structure. Furthermore, due to the unnaturalness of adversarial semantics, the generated adversarial examples have low transferability. These issues limit the utility of existing methods for assessing robustness. To address these issues, we propose AdvDiffVLM, which uses diffusion models to generate natural, unrestricted and targeted adversarial examples via score matching. Specifically, AdvDiffVLM uses Adaptive Ensemble Gradient Estimation to modify the score during the diffusion model's reverse generation process, ensuring that the produced adversarial examples have natural adversarial targeted semantics, which improves their transferability. Simultaneously, to improve the quality of adversarial examples, we use the GradCAM-guided Mask method to disperse adversarial semantics throughout the image rather than concentrating them in a single area. Finally, AdvDiffVLM embeds more target semantics into adversarial examples after multiple iterations. Experimental results show that our method generates adversarial examples 5x to 10x faster than state-of-the-art transfer-based adversarial attacks while maintaining higher quality adversarial examples. Furthermore, compared to previous transfer-based adversarial attacks, the adversarial examples generated by our method have better transferability. Notably, AdvDiffVLM can successfully attack a variety of commercial VLMs in a black-box environment, including GPT-4V.



## **20. Figure it Out: Analyzing-based Jailbreak Attack on Large Language Models**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-23    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16205v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16205v1)

**Authors**: Shi Lin, Rongchang Li, Xun Wang, Changting Lin, Wenpeng Xing, Meng Han

**Abstract**: The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought remarkable generative capabilities across diverse tasks. However, despite the impressive achievements, these models still have numerous security vulnerabilities, particularly when faced with jailbreak attacks. Therefore, by investigating jailbreak attacks, we can uncover hidden weaknesses in LLMs and guide us in developing more robust defense mechanisms to fortify their security. In this paper, we further explore the boundary of jailbreak attacks on LLMs and propose Analyzing-based Jailbreak (ABJ). This effective jailbreak attack method takes advantage of LLMs' growing analyzing and reasoning capability and reveals their underlying vulnerabilities when facing analysis-based tasks.

Our research highlights the importance of prioritizing and enhancing the safety of LLMs to mitigate the risks of misuse.

**Abstract**: This study examines integrating EHRs and NLP with large language models (LLMs) to improve healthcare data management and patient care. It focuses on using advanced models to create secure, HIPAA-compliant synthetic patient notes for biomedical research. The study used de-identified and re-identified MIMIC III datasets with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Mistral 7B to generate synthetic notes. Text generation employed templates and keyword extraction for contextually relevant notes, with one-shot generation for comparison. Privacy assessment checked PHI occurrence, while text utility was tested using an ICD-9 coding task. Text quality was evaluated with ROUGE and cosine similarity metrics to measure semantic similarity with source notes. Analysis of PHI occurrence and text utility via the ICD-9 coding task showed that the keyword-based method had low risk and good performance. One-shot generation showed the highest PHI exposure and PHI co-occurrence, especially in geographic location and date categories. The Normalized One-shot method achieved the highest classification accuracy. Privacy analysis revealed a critical balance between data utility and privacy protection, influencing future data use and sharing. Re-identified data consistently outperformed de-identified data. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of keyword-based methods in generating privacy-protecting synthetic clinical notes that retain data usability, potentially transforming clinical data-sharing practices. The superior performance of re-identified over de-identified data suggests a shift towards methods that enhance utility and privacy by using dummy PHIs to perplex privacy attacks.

**Abstract**: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in multi-agent systems has highlighted their impressive capabilities in various applications, such as collaborative problem-solving and autonomous negotiation. However, the security implications of these LLM-based multi-agent systems have not been thoroughly investigated, particularly concerning the spread of manipulated knowledge. In this paper, we investigate this critical issue by constructing a detailed threat model and a comprehensive simulation environment that mirrors real-world multi-agent deployments in a trusted platform. Subsequently, we propose a novel two-stage attack method involving Persuasiveness Injection and Manipulated Knowledge Injection to systematically explore the potential for manipulated knowledge (i.e., counterfactual and toxic knowledge) spread without explicit prompt manipulation.   Our method leverages the inherent vulnerabilities of LLMs in handling world knowledge, which can be exploited by attackers to unconsciously spread fabricated information. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our attack method can successfully induce LLM-based agents to spread both counterfactual and toxic knowledge without degrading their foundational capabilities during agent communication. Furthermore, we show that these manipulations can persist through popular retrieval-augmented generation frameworks, where several benign agents store and retrieve manipulated chat histories for future interactions. This persistence indicates that even after the interaction has ended, the benign agents may continue to be influenced by manipulated knowledge. Our findings reveal significant security risks in LLM-based multi-agent systems, emphasizing the imperative need for robust defenses against manipulated knowledge spread, such as introducing ``guardian'' agents and advanced fact-checking tools.

**Abstract**: Social engineering (SE) attacks remain a significant threat to both individuals and organizations. The advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), including diffusion models and large language models (LLMs), has potentially intensified these threats by enabling more personalized and convincing attacks. This survey paper categorizes SE attack mechanisms, analyzes their evolution, and explores methods for measuring these threats. It highlights the challenges in raising awareness about the risks of AI-enhanced SE attacks and offers insights into developing proactive and adaptable defense strategies. Additionally, we introduce a categorization of the evolving nature of AI-powered social engineering attacks into "3E phases": Enlarging, wherein the magnitude of attacks expands through the leverage of digital media; Enriching, introducing novel attack vectors and techniques; and Emerging, signifying the advent of novel threats and methods. Moreover, we emphasize the necessity for a robust framework to assess the risk of AI-powered SE attacks. By identifying and addressing gaps in existing research, we aim to guide future studies and encourage the development of more effective defenses against the growing threat of AI-powered social engineering.

**Abstract**: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent across many real-world applications, understanding and enhancing their robustness to adversarial attacks is of paramount importance. Existing methods for identifying adversarial prompts tend to focus on specific domains, lack diversity, or require extensive human annotations. To address these limitations, we present Rainbow Teaming, a novel black-box approach for producing a diverse collection of adversarial prompts. Rainbow Teaming casts adversarial prompt generation as a quality-diversity problem, and uses open-ended search to generate prompts that are both effective and diverse. Focusing on the safety domain, we use Rainbow Teaming to target various state-of-the-art LLMs, including the Llama 2 and Llama 3 models. Our approach reveals hundreds of effective adversarial prompts, with an attack success rate exceeding 90% across all tested models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning models with synthetic data generated by the Rainbow Teaming method significantly enhances their safety without sacrificing general performance or helpfulness. We additionally explore the versatility of Rainbow Teaming by applying it to question answering and cybersecurity, showcasing its potential to drive robust open-ended self-improvement in a wide range of applications.

**Authors**: Sungwon Park, Sungwon Han, Meeyoung Cha

**Abstract**: The spread of fake news negatively impacts individuals and is regarded as a significant social challenge that needs to be addressed. A number of algorithmic and insightful features have been identified for detecting fake news. However, with the recent LLMs and their advanced generation capabilities, many of the detectable features (e.g., style-conversion attacks) can be altered, making it more challenging to distinguish from real news. This study proposes adversarial style augmentation, AdStyle, to train a fake news detector that remains robust against various style-conversion attacks. Our model's key mechanism is the careful use of LLMs to automatically generate a diverse yet coherent range of style-conversion attack prompts. This improves the generation of prompts that are particularly difficult for the detector to handle. Experiments show that our augmentation strategy improves robustness and detection performance when tested on fake news benchmark datasets.

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) can often be made to behave in undesirable ways that they are explicitly fine-tuned not to. For example, the LLM red-teaming literature has produced a wide variety of `jailbreaking' techniques to elicit harmful text from models that were fine-tuned to be harmless. Recent work on red-teaming, model editing, and interpretability suggests that this challenge stems from how (adversarial) fine-tuning largely serves to suppress rather than remove undesirable capabilities from LLMs. Prior work has introduced latent adversarial training (LAT) as a way to improve robustness to broad classes of failures. These prior works have considered untargeted latent space attacks where the adversary perturbs latent activations to maximize loss on examples of desirable behavior. Untargeted LAT can provide a generic type of robustness but does not leverage information about specific failure modes. Here, we experiment with targeted LAT where the adversary seeks to minimize loss on a specific competing task. We find that it can augment a wide variety of state-of-the-art methods. First, we use targeted LAT to improve robustness to jailbreaks, outperforming a strong R2D2 baseline with orders of magnitude less compute. Second, we use it to more effectively remove backdoors with no knowledge of the trigger. Finally, we use it to more effectively unlearn knowledge for specific undesirable tasks in a way that is also more robust to re-learning. Overall, our results suggest that targeted LAT can be an effective tool for defending against harmful behaviors from LLMs.

**Authors**: Yuchen Yang, Hongwei Yao, Bingrun Yang, Yiling He, Yiming Li, Tianwei Zhang, Zhan Qin, Kui Ren

**Abstract**: Recently, code-oriented large language models (Code LLMs) have been widely and successfully used to simplify and facilitate code programming. With these tools, developers can easily generate desired complete functional codes based on incomplete code and natural language prompts. However, a few pioneering works revealed that these Code LLMs are also vulnerable, e.g., against backdoor and adversarial attacks. The former could induce LLMs to respond to triggers to insert malicious code snippets by poisoning the training data or model parameters, while the latter can craft malicious adversarial input codes to reduce the quality of generated codes. However, both attack methods have underlying limitations: backdoor attacks rely on controlling the model training process, while adversarial attacks struggle with fulfilling specific malicious purposes.   To inherit the advantages of both backdoor and adversarial attacks, this paper proposes a new attack paradigm, i.e., target-specific and adversarial prompt injection (TAPI), against Code LLMs. TAPI generates unreadable comments containing information about malicious instructions and hides them as triggers in the external source code. When users exploit Code LLMs to complete codes containing the trigger, the models will generate attacker-specified malicious code snippets at specific locations. We evaluate our TAPI attack on four representative LLMs under three representative malicious objectives and seven cases. The results show that our method is highly threatening (achieving an attack success rate of up to 98.3%) and stealthy (saving an average of 53.1% of tokens in the trigger design). In particular, we successfully attack some famous deployed code completion integrated applications, including CodeGeex and Github Copilot. This further confirms the realistic threat of our attack.

**Authors**: Xiao Liu, Liangzhi Li, Tong Xiang, Fuying Ye, Lu Wei, Wangyue Li, Noa Garcia

**Abstract**: With the development of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, both their vast applications and potential vulnerabilities have come to the forefront. While developers have integrated multiple safety mechanisms to mitigate their misuse, a risk remains, particularly when models encounter adversarial inputs. This study unveils an attack mechanism that capitalizes on human conversation strategies to extract harmful information from LLMs. We delineate three pivotal strategies: (i) decomposing malicious questions into seemingly innocent sub-questions; (ii) rewriting overtly malicious questions into more covert, benign-sounding ones; (iii) enhancing the harmfulness of responses by prompting models for illustrative examples. Unlike conventional methods that target explicit malicious responses, our approach delves deeper into the nature of the information provided in responses. Through our experiments conducted on GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and Llama2, our method has demonstrated a marked efficacy compared to conventional attack methods. In summary, this work introduces a novel attack method that outperforms previous approaches, raising an important question: How to discern whether the ultimate intent in a dialogue is malicious?

**Authors**: Reza Fayyazi, Rozhina Taghdimi, Shanchieh Jay Yang

**Abstract**: Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) outline the methods attackers use to exploit vulnerabilities. The interpretation of TTPs in the MITRE ATT&CK framework can be challenging for cybersecurity practitioners due to presumed expertise and complex dependencies. Meanwhile, advancements with Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to recent surge in studies exploring its uses in cybersecurity operations. It is, however, unclear how LLMs can be used in an efficient and proper way to provide accurate responses for critical domains such as cybersecurity. This leads us to investigate how to better use two types of LLMs: small-scale encoder-only (e.g., RoBERTa) and larger decoder-only (e.g., GPT-3.5) LLMs to comprehend and summarize TTPs with the intended purposes (i.e., tactics) of a cyberattack procedure. This work studies and compares the uses of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of encoder-only LLMs vs. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for decoder-only LLMs (without fine-tuning). Both SFT and RAG techniques presumably enhance the LLMs with relevant contexts for each cyberattack procedure. Our studies show decoder-only LLMs with RAG achieves better performance than encoder-only models with SFT, particularly when directly relevant context is extracted by RAG. The decoder-only results could suffer low `Precision' while achieving high `Recall'. Our findings further highlight a counter-intuitive observation that more generic prompts tend to yield better predictions of cyberattack tactics than those that are more specifically tailored.

**Abstract**: The integration of new modalities into frontier AI systems offers exciting capabilities, but also increases the possibility such systems can be adversarially manipulated in undesirable ways. In this work, we focus on a popular class of vision-language models (VLMs) that generate text outputs conditioned on visual and textual inputs. We conducted a large-scale empirical study to assess the transferability of gradient-based universal image "jailbreaks" using a diverse set of over 40 open-parameter VLMs, including 18 new VLMs that we publicly release. Overall, we find that transferable gradient-based image jailbreaks are extremely difficult to obtain. When an image jailbreak is optimized against a single VLM or against an ensemble of VLMs, the jailbreak successfully jailbreaks the attacked VLM(s), but exhibits little-to-no transfer to any other VLMs; transfer is not affected by whether the attacked and target VLMs possess matching vision backbones or language models, whether the language model underwent instruction-following and/or safety-alignment training, or many other factors. Only two settings display partially successful transfer: between identically-pretrained and identically-initialized VLMs with slightly different VLM training data, and between different training checkpoints of a single VLM. Leveraging these results, we then demonstrate that transfer can be significantly improved against a specific target VLM by attacking larger ensembles of "highly-similar" VLMs. These results stand in stark contrast to existing evidence of universal and transferable text jailbreaks against language models and transferable adversarial attacks against image classifiers, suggesting that VLMs may be more robust to gradient-based transfer attacks.

**Abstract**: Since the advent of generative artificial intelligence, every company and researcher has been rushing to develop their own generative models, whether commercial or not. Given the large number of users of these powerful new tools, there is currently no intrinsically verifiable way to explain from the ground up what happens when LLMs (large language models) learn. For example, those based on automatic speech recognition systems, which have to rely on huge and astronomical amounts of data collected from all over the web to produce fast and efficient results, In this article, we develop a backdoor attack called MarketBackFinal 2.0, based on acoustic data poisoning, MarketBackFinal 2.0 is mainly based on modern stock market models. In order to show the possible vulnerabilities of speech-based transformers that may rely on LLMs.

**Abstract**: Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) extend and enhance the perceptual abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite offering new possibilities for LLM applications, these advancements raise significant security and ethical concerns, particularly regarding the generation of harmful content. While LLMs have undergone extensive security evaluations with the aid of red teaming frameworks, VLMs currently lack a well-developed one. To fill this gap, we introduce Arondight, a standardized red team framework tailored specifically for VLMs. Arondight is dedicated to resolving issues related to the absence of visual modality and inadequate diversity encountered when transitioning existing red teaming methodologies from LLMs to VLMs. Our framework features an automated multi-modal jailbreak attack, wherein visual jailbreak prompts are produced by a red team VLM, and textual prompts are generated by a red team LLM guided by a reinforcement learning agent. To enhance the comprehensiveness of VLM security evaluation, we integrate entropy bonuses and novelty reward metrics. These elements incentivize the RL agent to guide the red team LLM in creating a wider array of diverse and previously unseen test cases. Our evaluation of ten cutting-edge VLMs exposes significant security vulnerabilities, particularly in generating toxic images and aligning multi-modal prompts. In particular, our Arondight achieves an average attack success rate of 84.5\% on GPT-4 in all fourteen prohibited scenarios defined by OpenAI in terms of generating toxic text. For a clearer comparison, we also categorize existing VLMs based on their safety levels and provide corresponding reinforcement recommendations. Our multimodal prompt dataset and red team code will be released after ethics committee approval. CONTENT WARNING: THIS PAPER CONTAINS HARMFUL MODEL RESPONSES.

**Authors**: Md Zarif Hossain, Ahmed Imteaj

**Abstract**: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved significant strides in recent times specially in multimodal tasks, yet they remain susceptible to adversarial attacks on their vision components. To address this, we propose Sim-CLIP, an unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning method that enhances the robustness of the widely-used CLIP vision encoder against such attacks while maintaining semantic richness and specificity. By employing a Siamese architecture with cosine similarity loss, Sim-CLIP learns semantically meaningful and attack-resilient visual representations without requiring large batch sizes or momentum encoders. Our results demonstrate that VLMs enhanced with Sim-CLIP's fine-tuned CLIP encoder exhibit significantly enhanced robustness against adversarial attacks, while preserving semantic meaning of the perturbed images. Notably, Sim-CLIP does not require additional training or fine-tuning of the VLM itself; replacing the original vision encoder with our fine-tuned Sim-CLIP suffices to provide robustness. This work underscores the significance of reinforcing foundational models like CLIP to safeguard the reliability of downstream VLM applications, paving the way for more secure and effective multimodal systems.

**Abstract**: Creating secure and resilient applications with large language models (LLM) requires anticipating, adjusting to, and countering unforeseen threats. Red-teaming has emerged as a critical technique for identifying vulnerabilities in real-world LLM implementations. This paper presents a detailed threat model and provides a systematization of knowledge (SoK) of red-teaming attacks on LLMs. We develop a taxonomy of attacks based on the stages of the LLM development and deployment process and extract various insights from previous research. In addition, we compile methods for defense and practical red-teaming strategies for practitioners. By delineating prominent attack motifs and shedding light on various entry points, this paper provides a framework for improving the security and robustness of LLM-based systems.

**Authors**: Mingke Yang, Yuqi Chen, Yi Liu, Ling Shi

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their remarkable capabilities in diverse domains, encompassing natural language understanding, translation, and even code generation. The potential for LLMs to generate harmful content is a significant concern. This risk necessitates rigorous testing and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs to ensure safe and responsible use. However, extensive testing of LLMs requires substantial computational resources, making it an expensive endeavor. Therefore, exploring cost-saving strategies during the testing phase is crucial to balance the need for thorough evaluation with the constraints of resource availability. To address this, our approach begins by transferring the moderation knowledge from an LLM to a small model. Subsequently, we deploy two distinct strategies for generating malicious queries: one based on a syntax tree approach, and the other leveraging an LLM-based method. Finally, our approach incorporates a sequential filter-test process designed to identify test cases that are prone to eliciting toxic responses. Our research evaluated the efficacy of DistillSeq across four LLMs: GPT-3.5, GPT-4.0, Vicuna-13B, and Llama-13B. In the absence of DistillSeq, the observed attack success rates on these LLMs stood at 31.5% for GPT-3.5, 21.4% for GPT-4.0, 28.3% for Vicuna-13B, and 30.9% for Llama-13B. However, upon the application of DistillSeq, these success rates notably increased to 58.5%, 50.7%, 52.5%, and 54.4%, respectively. This translated to an average escalation in attack success rate by a factor of 93.0% when compared to scenarios without the use of DistillSeq. Such findings highlight the significant enhancement DistillSeq offers in terms of reducing the time and resource investment required for effectively testing LLMs.

**Authors**: Jeffy Yu

**Abstract**: The rapid growth of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has been accompanied by substantial financial losses due to smart contract vulnerabilities, underscoring the critical need for effective security auditing. With attacks becoming more frequent, the necessity and demand for auditing services has escalated. This especially creates a financial burden for independent developers and small businesses, who often have limited available funding for these services. Our study builds upon existing frameworks by integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs), specifically employing GPT-4-1106 for its 128k token context window. We construct a vector store of 830 known vulnerable contracts, leveraging Pinecone for vector storage, OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 for embeddings, and LangChain to construct the RAG-LLM pipeline. Prompts were designed to provide a binary answer for vulnerability detection. We first test 52 smart contracts 40 times each against a provided vulnerability type, verifying the replicability and consistency of the RAG-LLM. Encouraging results were observed, with a 62.7% success rate in guided detection of vulnerabilities. Second, we challenge the model under a "blind" audit setup, without the vulnerability type provided in the prompt, wherein 219 contracts undergo 40 tests each. This setup evaluates the general vulnerability detection capabilities without hinted context assistance. Under these conditions, a 60.71% success rate was observed. While the results are promising, we still emphasize the need for human auditing at this time. We provide this study as a proof of concept for a cost-effective smart contract auditing process, moving towards democratic access to security.

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are employed across various high-stakes domains, where the reliability of their outputs is crucial. One commonly used method to assess the reliability of LLMs' responses is uncertainty estimation, which gauges the likelihood of their answers being correct. While many studies focus on improving the accuracy of uncertainty estimations for LLMs, our research investigates the fragility of uncertainty estimation and explores potential attacks. We demonstrate that an attacker can embed a backdoor in LLMs, which, when activated by a specific trigger in the input, manipulates the model's uncertainty without affecting the final output. Specifically, the proposed backdoor attack method can alter an LLM's output probability distribution, causing the probability distribution to converge towards an attacker-predefined distribution while ensuring that the top-1 prediction remains unchanged. Our experimental results demonstrate that this attack effectively undermines the model's self-evaluation reliability in multiple-choice questions. For instance, we achieved a 100 attack success rate (ASR) across three different triggering strategies in four models. Further, we investigate whether this manipulation generalizes across different prompts and domains. This work highlights a significant threat to the reliability of LLMs and underscores the need for future defenses against such attacks.

**Authors**: Sahar Abdelnabi, Aideen Fay, Giovanni Cherubin, Ahmed Salem, Mario Fritz, Andrew Paverd

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are routinely used in retrieval-augmented applications to orchestrate tasks and process inputs from users and other sources. These inputs, even in a single LLM interaction, can come from a variety of sources, of varying trustworthiness and provenance. This opens the door to prompt injection attacks, where the LLM receives and acts upon instructions from supposedly data-only sources, thus deviating from the user's original instructions. We define this as task drift, and we propose to catch it by scanning and analyzing the LLM's activations. We compare the LLM's activations before and after processing the external input in order to detect whether this input caused instruction drift. We develop two probing methods and find that simply using a linear classifier can detect drift with near perfect ROC AUC on an out-of-distribution test set. We show that this approach generalizes surprisingly well to unseen task domains, such as prompt injections, jailbreaks, and malicious instructions, without being trained on any of these attacks. Our setup does not require any modification of the LLM (e.g., fine-tuning) or any text generation, thus maximizing deployability and cost efficiency and avoiding reliance on unreliable model output. To foster future research on activation-based task inspection, decoding, and interpretability, we will release our large-scale TaskTracker toolkit, comprising a dataset of over 500K instances, representations from 5 SoTA language models, and inspection tools.

**Abstract**: Watermarking is a technique used to embed a hidden signal in the probability distribution of text generated by large language models (LLMs), enabling attribution of the text to the originating model. We introduce smoothing attacks and show that existing watermarking methods are not robust against minor modifications of text. An adversary can use weaker language models to smooth out the distribution perturbations caused by watermarks without significantly compromising the quality of the generated text. The modified text resulting from the smoothing attack remains close to the distribution of text that the original model (without watermark) would have produced. Our attack reveals a fundamental limitation of a wide range of watermarking techniques.

**Abstract**: The large language models (LLMs), which bridge the gap between human language understanding and complex problem-solving, achieve state-of-the-art performance on several NLP tasks, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot settings. Despite the demonstrable efficacy of LMMs, due to constraints on computational resources, users have to engage with open-source language models or outsource the entire training process to third-party platforms. However, research has demonstrated that language models are susceptible to potential security vulnerabilities, particularly in backdoor attacks. Backdoor attacks are designed to introduce targeted vulnerabilities into language models by poisoning training samples or model weights, allowing attackers to manipulate model responses through malicious triggers. While existing surveys on backdoor attacks provide a comprehensive overview, they lack an in-depth examination of backdoor attacks specifically targeting LLMs. To bridge this gap and grasp the latest trends in the field, this paper presents a novel perspective on backdoor attacks for LLMs by focusing on fine-tuning methods. Specifically, we systematically classify backdoor attacks into three categories: full-parameter fine-tuning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and attacks without fine-tuning. Based on insights from a substantial review, we also discuss crucial issues for future research on backdoor attacks, such as further exploring attack algorithms that do not require fine-tuning, or developing more covert attack algorithms.

**Authors**: Bangxin Li, Hengrui Xing, Chao Huang, Jin Qian, Huangqing Xiao, Linfeng Feng, Cong Tian

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in natural language processing but face the risk of jailbreak attacks that maliciously induce them to generate harmful content. Existing jailbreak attacks, including character-level and context-level attacks, mainly focus on the prompt of the plain text without specifically exploring the significant influence of its structure. In this paper, we focus on studying how prompt structure contributes to the jailbreak attack. We introduce a novel structure-level attack method based on tail structures that are rarely used during LLM training, which we refer to as Uncommon Text-Encoded Structure (UTES). We extensively study 12 UTESs templates and 6 obfuscation methods to build an effective automated jailbreak tool named StructuralSleight that contains three escalating attack strategies: Structural Attack, Structural and Character/Context Obfuscation Attack, and Fully Obfuscated Structural Attack. Extensive experiments on existing LLMs show that StructuralSleight significantly outperforms baseline methods. In particular, the attack success rate reaches 94.62\% on GPT-4o, which has not been addressed by state-of-the-art techniques.



## **43. Jailbreaking Black Box Large Language Models in Twenty Queries**

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-18    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08419v4) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08419v4)

**Authors**: Patrick Chao, Alexander Robey, Edgar Dobriban, Hamed Hassani, George J. Pappas, Eric Wong

**Abstract**: There is growing interest in ensuring that large language models (LLMs) align with human values. However, the alignment of such models is vulnerable to adversarial jailbreaks, which coax LLMs into overriding their safety guardrails. The identification of these vulnerabilities is therefore instrumental in understanding inherent weaknesses and preventing future misuse. To this end, we propose Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement (PAIR), an algorithm that generates semantic jailbreaks with only black-box access to an LLM. PAIR -- which is inspired by social engineering attacks -- uses an attacker LLM to automatically generate jailbreaks for a separate targeted LLM without human intervention. In this way, the attacker LLM iteratively queries the target LLM to update and refine a candidate jailbreak. Empirically, PAIR often requires fewer than twenty queries to produce a jailbreak, which is orders of magnitude more efficient than existing algorithms. PAIR also achieves competitive jailbreaking success rates and transferability on open and closed-source LLMs, including GPT-3.5/4, Vicuna, and Gemini.

**Authors**: Zhuo Chen, Jiawei Liu, Haotan Liu, Qikai Cheng, Fan Zhang, Wei Lu, Xiaozhong Liu

**Abstract**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is applied to solve hallucination problems and real-time constraints of large language models, but it also induces vulnerabilities against retrieval corruption attacks. Existing research mainly explores the unreliability of RAG in white-box and closed-domain QA tasks. In this paper, we aim to reveal the vulnerabilities of Retrieval-Enhanced Generative (RAG) models when faced with black-box attacks for opinion manipulation. We explore the impact of such attacks on user cognition and decision-making, providing new insight to enhance the reliability and security of RAG models. We manipulate the ranking results of the retrieval model in RAG with instruction and use these results as data to train a surrogate model. By employing adversarial retrieval attack methods to the surrogate model, black-box transfer attacks on RAG are further realized. Experiments conducted on opinion datasets across multiple topics show that the proposed attack strategy can significantly alter the opinion polarity of the content generated by RAG. This demonstrates the model's vulnerability and, more importantly, reveals the potential negative impact on user cognition and decision-making, making it easier to mislead users into accepting incorrect or biased information.



## **45. Prover-Verifier Games improve legibility of LLM outputs**

**Authors**: Jan Hendrik Kirchner, Yining Chen, Harri Edwards, Jan Leike, Nat McAleese, Yuri Burda

**Abstract**: One way to increase confidence in the outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs) is to support them with reasoning that is clear and easy to check -- a property we call legibility. We study legibility in the context of solving grade-school math problems and show that optimizing chain-of-thought solutions only for answer correctness can make them less legible. To mitigate the loss in legibility, we propose a training algorithm inspired by Prover-Verifier Game from Anil et al. (2021). Our algorithm iteratively trains small verifiers to predict solution correctness, "helpful" provers to produce correct solutions that the verifier accepts, and "sneaky" provers to produce incorrect solutions that fool the verifier. We find that the helpful prover's accuracy and the verifier's robustness to adversarial attacks increase over the course of training. Furthermore, we show that legibility training transfers to time-constrained humans tasked with verifying solution correctness. Over course of LLM training human accuracy increases when checking the helpful prover's solutions, and decreases when checking the sneaky prover's solutions. Hence, training for checkability by small verifiers is a plausible technique for increasing output legibility. Our results suggest legibility training against small verifiers as a practical avenue for increasing legibility of large LLMs to humans, and thus could help with alignment of superhuman models.

**Authors**: Shuli Jiang, Swanand Ravindra Kadhe, Yi Zhou, Farhan Ahmed, Ling Cai, Nathalie Baracaldo

**Abstract**: The increasing use of large language models (LLMs) trained by third parties raises significant security concerns. In particular, malicious actors can introduce backdoors through poisoning attacks to generate undesirable outputs. While such attacks have been extensively studied in image domains and classification tasks, they remain underexplored for natural language generation (NLG) tasks. To address this gap, we conduct an investigation of various poisoning techniques targeting the LLM's fine-tuning phase via prefix-tuning, a Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method. We assess their effectiveness across two generative tasks: text summarization and text completion; and we also introduce new metrics to quantify the success and stealthiness of such NLG poisoning attacks. Through our experiments, we find that the prefix-tuning hyperparameters and trigger designs are the most crucial factors to influence attack success and stealthiness. Moreover, we demonstrate that existing popular defenses are ineffective against our poisoning attacks. Our study presents the first systematic approach to understanding poisoning attacks targeting NLG tasks during fine-tuning via PEFT across a wide range of triggers and attack settings. We hope our findings will aid the AI security community in developing effective defenses against such threats.



## **47. Can LLMs Patch Security Issues?**

**Authors**: Kamel Alrashedy, Abdullah Aljasser, Pradyumna Tambwekar, Matthew Gombolay

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive proficiency in code generation. Unfortunately, these models share a weakness with their human counterparts: producing code that inadvertently has security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could allow unauthorized attackers to access sensitive data or systems, which is unacceptable for safety-critical applications. In this work, we propose Feedback-Driven Security Patching (FDSP), where LLMs automatically refine generated, vulnerable code. Our approach leverages automatic static code analysis to empower the LLM to generate and implement potential solutions to address vulnerabilities. We address the research communitys needs for safe code generation by introducing a large-scale dataset, PythonSecurityEval, covering the diversity of real-world applications, including databases, websites and operating systems. We empirically validate that FDSP outperforms prior work that uses self-feedback from LLMs by up to 17.6% through our procedure that injects targeted, external feedback.

**Authors**: Dong Shu, Mingyu Jin, Tianle Chen, Chong Zhang, Yongfeng Zhang

**Abstract**: This study sheds light on the imperative need to bolster safety and privacy measures in large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and LLaMA-2, by identifying and mitigating their vulnerabilities through explainable analysis of prompt attacks. We propose Counterfactual Explainable Incremental Prompt Attack (CEIPA), a novel technique where we guide prompts in a specific manner to quantitatively measure attack effectiveness and explore the embedded defense mechanisms in these models. Our approach is distinctive for its capacity to elucidate the reasons behind the generation of harmful responses by LLMs through an incremental counterfactual methodology. By organizing the prompt modification process into four incremental levels: (word, sentence, character, and a combination of character and word) we facilitate a thorough examination of the susceptibilities inherent to LLMs. The findings from our study not only provide counterfactual explanation insight but also demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the effectiveness of attack prompts.

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-17    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06134v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.06134v2)

**Authors**: Vyas Raina, Rao Ma, Charles McGhee, Kate Knill, Mark Gales

**Abstract**: Recent developments in large speech foundation models like Whisper have led to their widespread use in many automatic speech recognition (ASR) applications. These systems incorporate `special tokens' in their vocabulary, such as $\texttt{<|endoftext|>}$, to guide their language generation process. However, we demonstrate that these tokens can be exploited by adversarial attacks to manipulate the model's behavior. We propose a simple yet effective method to learn a universal acoustic realization of Whisper's $\texttt{<|endoftext|>}$ token, which, when prepended to any speech signal, encourages the model to ignore the speech and only transcribe the special token, effectively `muting' the model. Our experiments demonstrate that the same, universal 0.64-second adversarial audio segment can successfully mute a target Whisper ASR model for over 97\% of speech samples. Moreover, we find that this universal adversarial audio segment often transfers to new datasets and tasks. Overall this work demonstrates the vulnerability of Whisper models to `muting' adversarial attacks, where such attacks can pose both risks and potential benefits in real-world settings: for example the attack can be used to bypass speech moderation systems, or conversely the attack can also be used to protect private speech data.

**Authors**: Yulong Yang, Xinshan Yang, Shuaidong Li, Chenhao Lin, Zhengyu Zhao, Chao Shen, Tianwei Zhang

**Abstract**: The rapid progress in the reasoning capability of the Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has triggered the development of autonomous agent systems on mobile devices. MLLM-based mobile agent systems consist of perception, reasoning, memory, and multi-agent collaboration modules, enabling automatic analysis of user instructions and the design of task pipelines with only natural language and device screenshots as inputs. Despite the increased human-machine interaction efficiency, the security risks of MLLM-based mobile agent systems have not been systematically studied. Existing security benchmarks for agents mainly focus on Web scenarios, and the attack techniques against MLLMs are also limited in the mobile agent scenario. To close these gaps, this paper proposes a mobile agent security matrix covering 3 functional modules of the agent systems. Based on the security matrix, this paper proposes 4 realistic attack paths and verifies these attack paths through 8 attack methods. By analyzing the attack results, this paper reveals that MLLM-based mobile agent systems are not only vulnerable to multiple traditional attacks, but also raise new security concerns previously unconsidered. This paper highlights the need for security awareness in the design of MLLM-based systems and paves the way for future research on attacks and defense methods.
