cs.CL

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-19    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11282v3) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11282v3)

**Authors**: Qingcheng Zeng, Mingyu Jin, Qinkai Yu, Zhenting Wang, Wenyue Hua, Zihao Zhou, Guangyan Sun, Yanda Meng, Shiqing Ma, Qifan Wang, Felix Juefei-Xu, Kaize Ding, Fan Yang, Ruixiang Tang, Yongfeng Zhang

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are employed across various high-stakes domains, where the reliability of their outputs is crucial. One commonly used method to assess the reliability of LLMs' responses is uncertainty estimation, which gauges the likelihood of their answers being correct. While many studies focus on improving the accuracy of uncertainty estimations for LLMs, our research investigates the fragility of uncertainty estimation and explores potential attacks. We demonstrate that an attacker can embed a backdoor in LLMs, which, when activated by a specific trigger in the input, manipulates the model's uncertainty without affecting the final output. Specifically, the proposed backdoor attack method can alter an LLM's output probability distribution, causing the probability distribution to converge towards an attacker-predefined distribution while ensuring that the top-1 prediction remains unchanged. Our experimental results demonstrate that this attack effectively undermines the model's self-evaluation reliability in multiple-choice questions. For instance, we achieved a 100 attack success rate (ASR) across three different triggering strategies in four models. Further, we investigate whether this manipulation generalizes across different prompts and domains. This work highlights a significant threat to the reliability of LLMs and underscores the need for future defenses against such attacks.

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-19    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00799v4) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.00799v4)

**Authors**: Sahar Abdelnabi, Aideen Fay, Giovanni Cherubin, Ahmed Salem, Mario Fritz, Andrew Paverd

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are routinely used in retrieval-augmented applications to orchestrate tasks and process inputs from users and other sources. These inputs, even in a single LLM interaction, can come from a variety of sources, of varying trustworthiness and provenance. This opens the door to prompt injection attacks, where the LLM receives and acts upon instructions from supposedly data-only sources, thus deviating from the user's original instructions. We define this as task drift, and we propose to catch it by scanning and analyzing the LLM's activations. We compare the LLM's activations before and after processing the external input in order to detect whether this input caused instruction drift. We develop two probing methods and find that simply using a linear classifier can detect drift with near perfect ROC AUC on an out-of-distribution test set. We show that this approach generalizes surprisingly well to unseen task domains, such as prompt injections, jailbreaks, and malicious instructions, without being trained on any of these attacks. Our setup does not require any modification of the LLM (e.g., fine-tuning) or any text generation, thus maximizing deployability and cost efficiency and avoiding reliance on unreliable model output. To foster future research on activation-based task inspection, decoding, and interpretability, we will release our large-scale TaskTracker toolkit, comprising a dataset of over 500K instances, representations from 5 SoTA language models, and inspection tools.



## **3. Watermark Smoothing Attacks against Language Models**

cs.LG

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-19    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14206v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14206v1)

**Authors**: Hongyan Chang, Hamed Hassani, Reza Shokri

**Abstract**: Watermarking is a technique used to embed a hidden signal in the probability distribution of text generated by large language models (LLMs), enabling attribution of the text to the originating model. We introduce smoothing attacks and show that existing watermarking methods are not robust against minor modifications of text. An adversary can use weaker language models to smooth out the distribution perturbations caused by watermarks without significantly compromising the quality of the generated text. The modified text resulting from the smoothing attack remains close to the distribution of text that the original model (without watermark) would have produced. Our attack reveals a fundamental limitation of a wide range of watermarking techniques.



## **4. A Survey of Backdoor Attacks and Defenses on Large Language Models: Implications for Security Measures**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-19    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06852v3) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.06852v3)

**Authors**: Shuai Zhao, Meihuizi Jia, Zhongliang Guo, Leilei Gan, Xiaoyu Xu, Jie Fu, Yichao Feng, Fengjun Pan, Luu Anh Tuan

**Abstract**: The large language models (LLMs), which bridge the gap between human language understanding and complex problem-solving, achieve state-of-the-art performance on several NLP tasks, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot settings. Despite the demonstrable efficacy of LMMs, due to constraints on computational resources, users have to engage with open-source language models or outsource the entire training process to third-party platforms. However, research has demonstrated that language models are susceptible to potential security vulnerabilities, particularly in backdoor attacks. Backdoor attacks are designed to introduce targeted vulnerabilities into language models by poisoning training samples or model weights, allowing attackers to manipulate model responses through malicious triggers. While existing surveys on backdoor attacks provide a comprehensive overview, they lack an in-depth examination of backdoor attacks specifically targeting LLMs. To bridge this gap and grasp the latest trends in the field, this paper presents a novel perspective on backdoor attacks for LLMs by focusing on fine-tuning methods. Specifically, we systematically classify backdoor attacks into three categories: full-parameter fine-tuning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and attacks without fine-tuning. Based on insights from a substantial review, we also discuss crucial issues for future research on backdoor attacks, such as further exploring attack algorithms that do not require fine-tuning, or developing more covert attack algorithms.



## **5. Exploiting Uncommon Text-Encoded Structures for Automated Jailbreaks in LLMs**

cs.CL

12 pages, 4 figures

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-19    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08754v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08754v2)

**Authors**: Bangxin Li, Hengrui Xing, Chao Huang, Jin Qian, Huangqing Xiao, Linfeng Feng, Cong Tian

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in natural language processing but face the risk of jailbreak attacks that maliciously induce them to generate harmful content. Existing jailbreak attacks, including character-level and context-level attacks, mainly focus on the prompt of the plain text without specifically exploring the significant influence of its structure. In this paper, we focus on studying how prompt structure contributes to the jailbreak attack. We introduce a novel structure-level attack method based on tail structures that are rarely used during LLM training, which we refer to as Uncommon Text-Encoded Structure (UTES). We extensively study 12 UTESs templates and 6 obfuscation methods to build an effective automated jailbreak tool named StructuralSleight that contains three escalating attack strategies: Structural Attack, Structural and Character/Context Obfuscation Attack, and Fully Obfuscated Structural Attack. Extensive experiments on existing LLMs show that StructuralSleight significantly outperforms baseline methods. In particular, the attack success rate reaches 94.62\% on GPT-4o, which has not been addressed by state-of-the-art techniques.



## **6. Jailbreaking Black Box Large Language Models in Twenty Queries**

cs.LG

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-18    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08419v4) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08419v4)

**Authors**: Patrick Chao, Alexander Robey, Edgar Dobriban, Hamed Hassani, George J. Pappas, Eric Wong

**Abstract**: There is growing interest in ensuring that large language models (LLMs) align with human values. However, the alignment of such models is vulnerable to adversarial jailbreaks, which coax LLMs into overriding their safety guardrails. The identification of these vulnerabilities is therefore instrumental in understanding inherent weaknesses and preventing future misuse. To this end, we propose Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement (PAIR), an algorithm that generates semantic jailbreaks with only black-box access to an LLM. PAIR -- which is inspired by social engineering attacks -- uses an attacker LLM to automatically generate jailbreaks for a separate targeted LLM without human intervention. In this way, the attacker LLM iteratively queries the target LLM to update and refine a candidate jailbreak. Empirically, PAIR often requires fewer than twenty queries to produce a jailbreak, which is orders of magnitude more efficient than existing algorithms. PAIR also achieves competitive jailbreaking success rates and transferability on open and closed-source LLMs, including GPT-3.5/4, Vicuna, and Gemini.



## **7. Black-Box Opinion Manipulation Attacks to Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Large Language Models**

cs.CL

10 pages, 3 figures, under review

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-18    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13757v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13757v1)

**Authors**: Zhuo Chen, Jiawei Liu, Haotan Liu, Qikai Cheng, Fan Zhang, Wei Lu, Xiaozhong Liu

**Abstract**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is applied to solve hallucination problems and real-time constraints of large language models, but it also induces vulnerabilities against retrieval corruption attacks. Existing research mainly explores the unreliability of RAG in white-box and closed-domain QA tasks. In this paper, we aim to reveal the vulnerabilities of Retrieval-Enhanced Generative (RAG) models when faced with black-box attacks for opinion manipulation. We explore the impact of such attacks on user cognition and decision-making, providing new insight to enhance the reliability and security of RAG models. We manipulate the ranking results of the retrieval model in RAG with instruction and use these results as data to train a surrogate model. By employing adversarial retrieval attack methods to the surrogate model, black-box transfer attacks on RAG are further realized. Experiments conducted on opinion datasets across multiple topics show that the proposed attack strategy can significantly alter the opinion polarity of the content generated by RAG. This demonstrates the model's vulnerability and, more importantly, reveals the potential negative impact on user cognition and decision-making, making it easier to mislead users into accepting incorrect or biased information.



## **8. Prover-Verifier Games improve legibility of LLM outputs**

cs.CL

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-18    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13692v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13692v1)

**Authors**: Jan Hendrik Kirchner, Yining Chen, Harri Edwards, Jan Leike, Nat McAleese, Yuri Burda

**Abstract**: One way to increase confidence in the outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs) is to support them with reasoning that is clear and easy to check -- a property we call legibility. We study legibility in the context of solving grade-school math problems and show that optimizing chain-of-thought solutions only for answer correctness can make them less legible. To mitigate the loss in legibility, we propose a training algorithm inspired by Prover-Verifier Game from Anil et al. (2021). Our algorithm iteratively trains small verifiers to predict solution correctness, "helpful" provers to produce correct solutions that the verifier accepts, and "sneaky" provers to produce incorrect solutions that fool the verifier. We find that the helpful prover's accuracy and the verifier's robustness to adversarial attacks increase over the course of training. Furthermore, we show that legibility training transfers to time-constrained humans tasked with verifying solution correctness. Over course of LLM training human accuracy increases when checking the helpful prover's solutions, and decreases when checking the sneaky prover's solutions. Hence, training for checkability by small verifiers is a plausible technique for increasing output legibility. Our results suggest legibility training against small verifiers as a practical avenue for increasing legibility of large LLMs to humans, and thus could help with alignment of superhuman models.



## **9. Turning Generative Models Degenerate: The Power of Data Poisoning Attacks**

cs.CR

18 pages, 11 figures

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-18    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12281v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12281v2)

**Authors**: Shuli Jiang, Swanand Ravindra Kadhe, Yi Zhou, Farhan Ahmed, Ling Cai, Nathalie Baracaldo

**Abstract**: The increasing use of large language models (LLMs) trained by third parties raises significant security concerns. In particular, malicious actors can introduce backdoors through poisoning attacks to generate undesirable outputs. While such attacks have been extensively studied in image domains and classification tasks, they remain underexplored for natural language generation (NLG) tasks. To address this gap, we conduct an investigation of various poisoning techniques targeting the LLM's fine-tuning phase via prefix-tuning, a Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method. We assess their effectiveness across two generative tasks: text summarization and text completion; and we also introduce new metrics to quantify the success and stealthiness of such NLG poisoning attacks. Through our experiments, we find that the prefix-tuning hyperparameters and trigger designs are the most crucial factors to influence attack success and stealthiness. Moreover, we demonstrate that existing popular defenses are ineffective against our poisoning attacks. Our study presents the first systematic approach to understanding poisoning attacks targeting NLG tasks during fine-tuning via PEFT across a wide range of triggers and attack settings. We hope our findings will aid the AI security community in developing effective defenses against such threats.



## **10. Can LLMs Patch Security Issues?**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-18    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00024v4) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00024v4)

**Authors**: Kamel Alrashedy, Abdullah Aljasser, Pradyumna Tambwekar, Matthew Gombolay

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive proficiency in code generation. Unfortunately, these models share a weakness with their human counterparts: producing code that inadvertently has security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could allow unauthorized attackers to access sensitive data or systems, which is unacceptable for safety-critical applications. In this work, we propose Feedback-Driven Security Patching (FDSP), where LLMs automatically refine generated, vulnerable code. Our approach leverages automatic static code analysis to empower the LLM to generate and implement potential solutions to address vulnerabilities. We address the research communitys needs for safe code generation by introducing a large-scale dataset, PythonSecurityEval, covering the diversity of real-world applications, including databases, websites and operating systems. We empirically validate that FDSP outperforms prior work that uses self-feedback from LLMs by up to 17.6% through our procedure that injects targeted, external feedback.

## **11. Counterfactual Explainable Incremental Prompt Attack Analysis on Large Language Models**

cs.CR

23 pages, 6 figures

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-17    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09292v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09292v2)

**Authors**: Dong Shu, Mingyu Jin, Tianle Chen, Chong Zhang, Yongfeng Zhang

**Abstract**: This study sheds light on the imperative need to bolster safety and privacy measures in large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and LLaMA-2, by identifying and mitigating their vulnerabilities through explainable analysis of prompt attacks. We propose Counterfactual Explainable Incremental Prompt Attack (CEIPA), a novel technique where we guide prompts in a specific manner to quantitatively measure attack effectiveness and explore the embedded defense mechanisms in these models. Our approach is distinctive for its capacity to elucidate the reasons behind the generation of harmful responses by LLMs through an incremental counterfactual methodology. By organizing the prompt modification process into four incremental levels: (word, sentence, character, and a combination of character and word) we facilitate a thorough examination of the susceptibilities inherent to LLMs. The findings from our study not only provide counterfactual explanation insight but also demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the effectiveness of attack prompts.



## **12. Muting Whisper: A Universal Acoustic Adversarial Attack on Speech Foundation Models**

cs.CL

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-17    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06134v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.06134v2)

**Authors**: Vyas Raina, Rao Ma, Charles McGhee, Kate Knill, Mark Gales

**Abstract**: Recent developments in large speech foundation models like Whisper have led to their widespread use in many automatic speech recognition (ASR) applications. These systems incorporate `special tokens' in their vocabulary, such as $\texttt{<|endoftext|>}$, to guide their language generation process. However, we demonstrate that these tokens can be exploited by adversarial attacks to manipulate the model's behavior. We propose a simple yet effective method to learn a universal acoustic realization of Whisper's $\texttt{<|endoftext|>}$ token, which, when prepended to any speech signal, encourages the model to ignore the speech and only transcribe the special token, effectively `muting' the model. Our experiments demonstrate that the same, universal 0.64-second adversarial audio segment can successfully mute a target Whisper ASR model for over 97\% of speech samples. Moreover, we find that this universal adversarial audio segment often transfers to new datasets and tasks. Overall this work demonstrates the vulnerability of Whisper models to `muting' adversarial attacks, where such attacks can pose both risks and potential benefits in real-world settings: for example the attack can be used to bypass speech moderation systems, or conversely the attack can also be used to protect private speech data.



## **13. Security Matrix for Multimodal Agents on Mobile Devices: A Systematic and Proof of Concept Study**

cs.CR

Preprint. Work in progress

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-17    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09295v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09295v2)

**Authors**: Yulong Yang, Xinshan Yang, Shuaidong Li, Chenhao Lin, Zhengyu Zhao, Chao Shen, Tianwei Zhang

**Abstract**: The rapid progress in the reasoning capability of the Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has triggered the development of autonomous agent systems on mobile devices. MLLM-based mobile agent systems consist of perception, reasoning, memory, and multi-agent collaboration modules, enabling automatic analysis of user instructions and the design of task pipelines with only natural language and device screenshots as inputs. Despite the increased human-machine interaction efficiency, the security risks of MLLM-based mobile agent systems have not been systematically studied. Existing security benchmarks for agents mainly focus on Web scenarios, and the attack techniques against MLLMs are also limited in the mobile agent scenario. To close these gaps, this paper proposes a mobile agent security matrix covering 3 functional modules of the agent systems. Based on the security matrix, this paper proposes 4 realistic attack paths and verifies these attack paths through 8 attack methods. By analyzing the attack results, this paper reveals that MLLM-based mobile agent systems are not only vulnerable to multiple traditional attacks, but also raise new security concerns previously unconsidered. This paper highlights the need for security awareness in the design of MLLM-based systems and paves the way for future research on attacks and defense methods.



## **14. DistillSeq: A Framework for Safety Alignment Testing in Large Language Models using Knowledge Distillation**

cs.SE

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-17    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10106v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10106v2)

**Authors**: Mingke Yang, Yuqi Chen, Yi Liu, Ling Shi

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their remarkable capabilities in diverse domains, encompassing natural language understanding, translation, and even code generation. The potential for LLMs to generate harmful content is a significant concern. This risk necessitates rigorous testing and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs to ensure safe and responsible use. However, extensive testing of LLMs requires substantial computational resources, making it an expensive endeavor. Therefore, exploring cost-saving strategies during the testing phase is crucial to balance the need for thorough evaluation with the constraints of resource availability. To address this, our approach begins by transferring the moderation knowledge from an LLM to a small model. Subsequently, we deploy two distinct strategies for generating malicious queries: one based on a syntax tree approach, and the other leveraging an LLM-based method. Finally, our approach incorporates a sequential filter-test process designed to identify test cases that are prone to eliciting toxic responses. Our research evaluated the efficacy of DistillSeq across four LLMs: GPT-3.5, GPT-4.0, Vicuna-13B, and Llama-13B. In the absence of DistillSeq, the observed attack success rates on these LLMs stood at 31.5% for GPT-3.5, 21.4% for GPT-4.0, 28.3% for Vicuna-13B, and 30.9% for Llama-13B. However, upon the application of DistillSeq, these success rates notably increased to 58.5%, 50.7%, 52.5%, and 54.4%, respectively. This translated to an average escalation in attack success rate by a factor of 93.0% when compared to scenarios without the use of DistillSeq. Such findings highlight the significant enhancement DistillSeq offers in terms of reducing the time and resource investment required for effectively testing LLMs.



## **15. The First to Know: How Token Distributions Reveal Hidden Knowledge in Large Vision-Language Models?**

cs.CV

ECCV 2024. Project page: https://github.com/Qinyu-Allen-Zhao/LVLM-LP

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-17    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09037v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.09037v2)

**Authors**: Qinyu Zhao, Ming Xu, Kartik Gupta, Akshay Asthana, Liang Zheng, Stephen Gould

**Abstract**: Large vision-language models (LVLMs), designed to interpret and respond to human instructions, occasionally generate hallucinated or harmful content due to inappropriate instructions. This study uses linear probing to shed light on the hidden knowledge at the output layers of LVLMs. We demonstrate that the logit distributions of the first tokens contain sufficient information to determine whether to respond to the instructions, including recognizing unanswerable visual questions, defending against jailbreaking attacks, and identifying deceptive questions. Such hidden knowledge is gradually lost in logits of subsequent tokens during response generation. Then, we illustrate a simple decoding strategy at the generation of the first token, effectively improving the generated content. In experiments, we find a few interesting insights: First, the CLIP model already contains a strong signal for solving these tasks, which indicates potential bias in the existing datasets. Second, we observe performance improvement by utilizing the first logit distributions on three additional tasks, including indicating uncertainty in math solving, mitigating hallucination, and image classification. Last, with the same training data, simply finetuning LVLMs improves models' performance but is still inferior to linear probing on these tasks.



## **16. Revisiting the Adversarial Robustness of Vision Language Models: a Multimodal Perspective**

cs.CV

16 pages, 14 figures

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-17    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19287v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19287v2)

**Authors**: Wanqi Zhou, Shuanghao Bai, Qibin Zhao, Badong Chen

**Abstract**: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive generalization performance across various downstream tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While prior research has primarily concentrated on improving the adversarial robustness of image encoders to guard against attacks on images, the exploration of text-based and multimodal attacks has largely been overlooked. In this work, we initiate the first known and comprehensive effort to study adapting vision-language models for adversarial robustness under the multimodal attack. Firstly, we introduce a multimodal attack strategy and investigate the impact of different attacks. We then propose a multimodal contrastive adversarial training loss, aligning the clean and adversarial text embeddings with the adversarial and clean visual features, to enhance the adversarial robustness of both image and text encoders of CLIP. Extensive experiments on 15 datasets across two tasks demonstrate that our method significantly improves the adversarial robustness of CLIP. Interestingly, we find that the model fine-tuned against multimodal adversarial attacks exhibits greater robustness than its counterpart fine-tuned solely against image-based attacks, even in the context of image attacks, which may open up new possibilities for enhancing the security of VLMs.



## **17. Continuous Embedding Attacks via Clipped Inputs in Jailbreaking Large Language Models**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-16    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13796v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13796v1)

**Authors**: Zihao Xu, Yi Liu, Gelei Deng, Kailong Wang, Yuekang Li, Ling Shi, Stjepan Picek

**Abstract**: Security concerns for large language models (LLMs) have recently escalated, focusing on thwarting jailbreaking attempts in discrete prompts. However, the exploration of jailbreak vulnerabilities arising from continuous embeddings has been limited, as prior approaches primarily involved appending discrete or continuous suffixes to inputs. Our study presents a novel channel for conducting direct attacks on LLM inputs, eliminating the need for suffix addition or specific questions provided that the desired output is predefined. We additionally observe that extensive iterations often lead to overfitting, characterized by repetition in the output. To counteract this, we propose a simple yet effective strategy named CLIP. Our experiments show that for an input length of 40 at iteration 1000, applying CLIP improves the ASR from 62% to 83%



## **18. JailbreakBench: An Open Robustness Benchmark for Jailbreaking Large Language Models**

cs.CR

JailbreakBench v1.0: more attack artifacts, more test-time defenses,  a more accurate jailbreak judge (Llama-3-70B with a custom prompt), a larger  dataset of human preferences for selecting a jailbreak judge (300 examples),  an over-refusal evaluation dataset (100 benign/borderline behaviors), a  semantic refusal judge based on Llama-3-8B

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-16    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01318v4) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01318v4)

**Authors**: Patrick Chao, Edoardo Debenedetti, Alexander Robey, Maksym Andriushchenko, Francesco Croce, Vikash Sehwag, Edgar Dobriban, Nicolas Flammarion, George J. Pappas, Florian Tramer, Hamed Hassani, Eric Wong

**Abstract**: Jailbreak attacks cause large language models (LLMs) to generate harmful, unethical, or otherwise objectionable content. Evaluating these attacks presents a number of challenges, which the current collection of benchmarks and evaluation techniques do not adequately address. First, there is no clear standard of practice regarding jailbreaking evaluation. Second, existing works compute costs and success rates in incomparable ways. And third, numerous works are not reproducible, as they withhold adversarial prompts, involve closed-source code, or rely on evolving proprietary APIs. To address these challenges, we introduce JailbreakBench, an open-sourced benchmark with the following components: (1) an evolving repository of state-of-the-art adversarial prompts, which we refer to as jailbreak artifacts; (2) a jailbreaking dataset comprising 100 behaviors -- both original and sourced from prior work (Zou et al., 2023; Mazeika et al., 2023, 2024) -- which align with OpenAI's usage policies; (3) a standardized evaluation framework at https://github.com/JailbreakBench/jailbreakbench that includes a clearly defined threat model, system prompts, chat templates, and scoring functions; and (4) a leaderboard at https://jailbreakbench.github.io/ that tracks the performance of attacks and defenses for various LLMs. We have carefully considered the potential ethical implications of releasing this benchmark, and believe that it will be a net positive for the community.



## **19. Exploring the Robustness of Decision-Level Through Adversarial Attacks on LLM-Based Embodied Models**

cs.MM

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-16    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19802v3) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.19802v3)

**Authors**: Shuyuan Liu, Jiawei Chen, Shouwei Ruan, Hang Su, Zhaoxia Yin

**Abstract**: Embodied intelligence empowers agents with a profound sense of perception, enabling them to respond in a manner closely aligned with real-world situations. Large Language Models (LLMs) delve into language instructions with depth, serving a crucial role in generating plans for intricate tasks. Thus, LLM-based embodied models further enhance the agent's capacity to comprehend and process information. However, this amalgamation also ushers in new challenges in the pursuit of heightened intelligence. Specifically, attackers can manipulate LLMs to produce irrelevant or even malicious outputs by altering their prompts. Confronted with this challenge, we observe a notable absence of multi-modal datasets essential for comprehensively evaluating the robustness of LLM-based embodied models. Consequently, we construct the Embodied Intelligent Robot Attack Dataset (EIRAD), tailored specifically for robustness evaluation. Additionally, two attack strategies are devised, including untargeted attacks and targeted attacks, to effectively simulate a range of diverse attack scenarios. At the same time, during the attack process, to more accurately ascertain whether our method is successful in attacking the LLM-based embodied model, we devise a new attack success evaluation method utilizing the BLIP2 model. Recognizing the time and cost-intensive nature of the GCG algorithm in attacks, we devise a scheme for prompt suffix initialization based on various target tasks, thus expediting the convergence process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits a superior attack success rate when targeting LLM-based embodied models, indicating a lower level of decision-level robustness in these models.



## **20. Robust Utility-Preserving Text Anonymization Based on Large Language Models**

cs.CL

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-16    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11770v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11770v1)

**Authors**: Tianyu Yang, Xiaodan Zhu, Iryna Gurevych

**Abstract**: Text anonymization is crucial for sharing sensitive data while maintaining privacy. Existing techniques face the emerging challenges of re-identification attack ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), which have shown advanced capability in memorizing detailed information and patterns as well as connecting disparate pieces of information. In defending against LLM-based re-identification attacks, anonymization could jeopardize the utility of the resulting anonymized data in downstream tasks -- the trade-off between privacy and data utility requires deeper understanding within the context of LLMs. This paper proposes a framework composed of three LLM-based components -- a privacy evaluator, a utility evaluator, and an optimization component, which work collaboratively to perform anonymization. To provide a practical model for large-scale and real-time environments, we distill the anonymization capabilities into a lightweight model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed models outperform baseline models, showing robustness in reducing the risk of re-identification while preserving greater data utility in downstream tasks. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/UKPLab/arxiv2024-rupta.

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks. Recently, several LLMs-based pipelines have been developed to enhance learning on graphs with text attributes, showcasing promising performance. However, graphs are well-known to be susceptible to adversarial attacks and it remains unclear whether LLMs exhibit robustness in learning on graphs. To address this gap, our work aims to explore the potential of LLMs in the context of adversarial attacks on graphs. Specifically, we investigate the robustness against graph structural and textual perturbations in terms of two dimensions: LLMs-as-Enhancers and LLMs-as-Predictors. Through extensive experiments, we find that, compared to shallow models, both LLMs-as-Enhancers and LLMs-as-Predictors offer superior robustness against structural and textual attacks.Based on these findings, we carried out additional analyses to investigate the underlying causes. Furthermore, we have made our benchmark library openly available to facilitate quick and fair evaluations, and to encourage ongoing innovative research in this field.

**Abstract**: The increasing reliance on Large Language Models (LLMs) across academia and industry necessitates a comprehensive understanding of their robustness to prompts. In response to this vital need, we introduce PromptRobust, a robustness benchmark designed to measure LLMs' resilience to adversarial prompts. This study uses a plethora of adversarial textual attacks targeting prompts across multiple levels: character, word, sentence, and semantic. The adversarial prompts, crafted to mimic plausible user errors like typos or synonyms, aim to evaluate how slight deviations can affect LLM outcomes while maintaining semantic integrity. These prompts are then employed in diverse tasks including sentiment analysis, natural language inference, reading comprehension, machine translation, and math problem-solving. Our study generates 4,788 adversarial prompts, meticulously evaluated over 8 tasks and 13 datasets. Our findings demonstrate that contemporary LLMs are not robust to adversarial prompts. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive analysis to understand the mystery behind prompt robustness and its transferability. We then offer insightful robustness analysis and pragmatic recommendations for prompt composition, beneficial to both researchers and everyday users.

**Authors**: Yu-Tsung Lee, Hayawardh Vijayakumar, Zhiyun Qian, Trent Jaeger

**Abstract**: Filesystem vulnerabilities persist as a significant threat to Android systems, despite various proposed defenses and testing techniques. The complexity of program behaviors and access control mechanisms in Android systems makes it challenging to effectively identify these vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present PathSentinel, which overcomes the limitations of previous techniques by combining static program analysis and access control policy analysis to detect three types of filesystem vulnerabilities: path traversals, hijacking vulnerabilities, and luring vulnerabilities. By unifying program and access control policy analysis, PathSentinel identifies attack surfaces accurately and prunes many impractical attacks to generate input payloads for vulnerability testing. To streamline vulnerability validation, PathSentinel leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate targeted exploit code based on the identified vulnerabilities and generated input payloads. The LLMs serve as a tool to reduce the engineering effort required for writing test applications, demonstrating the potential of combining static analysis with LLMs to enhance the efficiency of exploit generation and vulnerability validation. Evaluation on Android 12 and 14 systems from Samsung and OnePlus demonstrates PathSentinel's effectiveness, uncovering 51 previously unknown vulnerabilities among 217 apps with only 2 false positives. These results underscore the importance of combining program and access control policy analysis for accurate vulnerability detection and highlight the promising direction of integrating LLMs for automated exploit generation, providing a comprehensive approach to enhancing the security of Android systems against filesystem vulnerabilities.

**Authors**: Matthieu Meeus, Shubham Jain, Marek Rei, Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye

**Abstract**: With large language models (LLMs) poised to become embedded in our daily lives, questions are starting to be raised about the data they learned from. These questions range from potential bias or misinformation LLMs could retain from their training data to questions of copyright and fair use of human-generated text. However, while these questions emerge, developers of the recent state-of-the-art LLMs become increasingly reluctant to disclose details on their training corpus. We here introduce the task of document-level membership inference for real-world LLMs, i.e. inferring whether the LLM has seen a given document during training or not. First, we propose a procedure for the development and evaluation of document-level membership inference for LLMs by leveraging commonly used data sources for training and the model release date. We then propose a practical, black-box method to predict document-level membership and instantiate it on OpenLLaMA-7B with both books and academic papers. We show our methodology to perform very well, reaching an AUC of 0.856 for books and 0.678 for papers. We then show our approach to outperform the sentence-level membership inference attacks used in the privacy literature for the document-level membership task. We further evaluate whether smaller models might be less sensitive to document-level inference and show OpenLLaMA-3B to be approximately as sensitive as OpenLLaMA-7B to our approach. Finally, we consider two mitigation strategies and find the AUC to slowly decrease when only partial documents are considered but to remain fairly high when the model precision is reduced. Taken together, our results show that accurate document-level membership can be inferred for LLMs, increasing the transparency of technology poised to change our lives.

**Authors**: Yehonathan Refael, Adam Hakim, Lev Greenberg, Tal Aviv, Satya Lokam, Ben Fishman, Shachar Seidman

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have recently seen widespread adoption, in both academia and industry. As these models grow, they become valuable intellectual property (IP), reflecting enormous investments by their owners. Moreover, the high cost of cloud-based deployment has driven interest towards deployment to edge devices, yet this risks exposing valuable parameters to theft and unauthorized use. Current methods to protect models' IP on the edge have limitations in terms of practicality, loss in accuracy, or suitability to requirements. In this paper, we introduce a novel hybrid inference algorithm, named SLIP, designed to protect edge-deployed models from theft. SLIP is the first hybrid protocol that is both practical for real-world applications and provably secure, while having zero accuracy degradation and minimal impact on latency. It involves partitioning the model between two computing resources, one secure but expensive, and another cost-effective but vulnerable. This is achieved through matrix decomposition, ensuring that the secure resource retains a maximally sensitive portion of the model's IP while performing a minimal amount of computations, and vice versa for the vulnerable resource. Importantly, the protocol includes security guarantees that prevent attackers from exploiting the partition to infer the secured information. Finally, we present experimental results that show the robustness and effectiveness of our method, positioning it as a compelling solution for protecting LLMs.

**Authors**: Yuchen Yang, Hongwei Yao, Bingrun Yang, Yiling He, Yiming Li, Tianwei Zhang, Zhan Qin, Kui Ren

**Abstract**: Recently, code-oriented large language models (Code LLMs) have been widely and successfully used to simplify and facilitate code programming. With these tools, developers can easily generate desired complete functional codes based on incomplete code and natural language prompts. However, a few pioneering works revealed that these Code LLMs are also vulnerable, e.g., against backdoor and adversarial attacks. The former could induce LLMs to respond to triggers to insert malicious code snippets by poisoning the training data or model parameters, while the latter can craft malicious adversarial input codes to reduce the quality of generated codes. However, both attack methods have underlying limitations: backdoor attacks rely on controlling the model training process, while adversarial attacks struggle with fulfilling specific malicious purposes.   To inherit the advantages of both backdoor and adversarial attacks, this paper proposes a new attack paradigm, i.e., target-specific and adversarial prompt injection (TAPI), against Code LLMs. TAPI generates unreadable comments containing information about malicious instructions and hides them as triggers in the external source code. When users exploit Code LLMs to complete codes containing the trigger, the models will generate attacker-specified malicious code snippets at specific locations. We evaluate our TAPI attack on four representative LLMs under three representative malicious objectives and seven cases. The results show that our method is highly threatening (achieving an attack success rate enhancement of up to 89.3%) and stealthy (saving an average of 53.1% of tokens in the trigger design). In particular, we successfully attack some famous deployed code completion integrated applications, including CodeGeex and Github Copilot. This further confirms the realistic threat of our attack.

**Authors**: Yunhao Gou, Kai Chen, Zhili Liu, Lanqing Hong, Hang Xu, Zhenguo Li, Dit-Yan Yeung, James T. Kwok, Yu Zhang

**Abstract**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive reasoning abilities. However, they are also more vulnerable to jailbreak attacks than their LLM predecessors. Although still capable of detecting the unsafe responses, we observe that safety mechanisms of the pre-aligned LLMs in MLLMs can be easily bypassed with the introduction of image features. To construct robust MLLMs, we propose ECSO (Eyes Closed, Safety On), a novel training-free protecting approach that exploits the inherent safety awareness of MLLMs, and generates safer responses via adaptively transforming unsafe images into texts to activate the intrinsic safety mechanism of pre-aligned LLMs in MLLMs. Experiments on five state-of-the-art (SoTA) MLLMs demonstrate that ECSO enhances model safety significantly (e.g.,, 37.6% improvement on the MM-SafetyBench (SD+OCR) and 71.3% on VLSafe with LLaVA-1.5-7B), while consistently maintaining utility results on common MLLM benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that ECSO can be used as a data engine to generate supervised-finetuning (SFT) data for MLLM alignment without extra human intervention.

**Authors**: Jeffrey G. Wang, Jason Wang, Marvin Li, Seth Neel

**Abstract**: In this paper we develop state-of-the-art privacy attacks against Large Language Models (LLMs), where an adversary with some access to the model tries to learn something about the underlying training data. Our headline results are new membership inference attacks (MIAs) against pretrained LLMs that perform hundreds of times better than baseline attacks, and a pipeline showing that over 50% (!) of the fine-tuning dataset can be extracted from a fine-tuned LLM in natural settings. We consider varying degrees of access to the underlying model, pretraining and fine-tuning data, and both MIAs and training data extraction. For pretraining data, we propose two new MIAs: a supervised neural network classifier that predicts training data membership on the basis of (dimensionality-reduced) model gradients, as well as a variant of this attack that only requires logit access to the model by leveraging recent model-stealing work on LLMs. To our knowledge this is the first MIA that explicitly incorporates model-stealing information. Both attacks outperform existing black-box baselines, and our supervised attack closes the gap between MIA attack success against LLMs and the strongest known attacks for other machine learning models. In fine-tuning, we find that a simple attack based on the ratio of the loss between the base and fine-tuned models is able to achieve near-perfect MIA performance; we then leverage our MIA to extract a large fraction of the fine-tuning dataset from fine-tuned Pythia and Llama models.

**Authors**: Victor Gallego

**Abstract**: The robustness of large language models (LLMs) against adversarial manipulations, such as jailbreak attacks, remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose an approach that enhances the self-critique capability of the LLM and further fine-tunes it over sanitized synthetic data. This is done with the addition of an external critic model that can be merged with the original, thus bolstering self-critique capabilities and improving the robustness of the LLMs response to adversarial prompts. Our results demonstrate that the combination of merging and self-critique can reduce the attack success rate of adversaries significantly, thus offering a promising defense mechanism against jailbreak attacks.

**Authors**: Yixin Liu, Hongsheng Hu, Xun Chen, Xuyun Zhang, Lichao Sun

**Abstract**: Substantial research works have shown that deep models, e.g., pre-trained models, on the large corpus can learn universal language representations, which are beneficial for downstream NLP tasks. However, these powerful models are also vulnerable to various privacy attacks, while much sensitive information exists in the training dataset. The attacker can easily steal sensitive information from public models, e.g., individuals' email addresses and phone numbers. In an attempt to address these issues, particularly the unauthorized use of private data, we introduce a novel watermarking technique via a backdoor-based membership inference approach named TextMarker, which can safeguard diverse forms of private information embedded in the training text data. Specifically, TextMarker only requires data owners to mark a small number of samples for data copyright protection under the black-box access assumption to the target model. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TextMarker on various real-world datasets, e.g., marking only 0.1% of the training dataset is practically sufficient for effective membership inference with negligible effect on model utility. We also discuss potential countermeasures and show that TextMarker is stealthy enough to bypass them.

**Authors**: Youliang Yuan, Wenxiang Jiao, Wenxuan Wang, Jen-tse Huang, Jiahao Xu, Tian Liang, Pinjia He, Zhaopeng Tu

**Abstract**: This study addresses a critical gap in safety tuning practices for Large Language Models (LLMs) by identifying and tackling a refusal position bias within safety tuning data, which compromises the models' ability to appropriately refuse generating unsafe content. We introduce a novel approach, Decoupled Refusal Training (DeRTa), designed to empower LLMs to refuse compliance to harmful prompts at any response position, significantly enhancing their safety capabilities. DeRTa incorporates two novel components: (1) Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with Harmful Response Prefix, which trains models to recognize and avoid unsafe content by appending a segment of harmful response to the beginning of a safe response, and (2) Reinforced Transition Optimization (RTO), which equips models with the ability to transition from potential harm to safety refusal consistently throughout the harmful response sequence. Our empirical evaluation, conducted using LLaMA3 and Mistral model families across six attack scenarios, demonstrates that our method not only improves model safety without compromising performance but also surpasses well-known models such as GPT-4 in defending against attacks. Importantly, our approach successfully defends recent advanced attack methods (e.g., CodeAttack) that have jailbroken GPT-4 and LLaMA3-70B-Instruct.

**Authors**: Zhihui Xie, Jiahui Gao, Lei Li, Zhenguo Li, Qi Liu, Lingpeng Kong

**Abstract**: The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about their safety and reliability, particularly regarding their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective that attributes this vulnerability to reward misspecification during the alignment process. We introduce a metric ReGap to quantify the extent of reward misspecification and demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness in detecting harmful backdoor prompts. Building upon these insights, we present ReMiss, a system for automated red teaming that generates adversarial prompts against various target aligned LLMs. ReMiss achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates on the AdvBench benchmark while preserving the human readability of the generated prompts. Detailed analysis highlights the unique advantages brought by the proposed reward misspecification objective compared to previous methods.

**Authors**: Daizong Liu, Mingyu Yang, Xiaoye Qu, Pan Zhou, Yu Cheng, Wei Hu

**Abstract**: With the significant development of large models in recent years, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of multimodal understanding and reasoning tasks. Compared to traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), LVLMs present great potential and challenges due to its closer proximity to the multi-resource real-world applications and the complexity of multi-modal processing. However, the vulnerability of LVLMs is relatively underexplored, posing potential security risks in daily usage. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the various forms of existing LVLM attacks. Specifically, we first introduce the background of attacks targeting LVLMs, including the attack preliminary, attack challenges, and attack resources. Then, we systematically review the development of LVLM attack methods, such as adversarial attacks that manipulate model outputs, jailbreak attacks that exploit model vulnerabilities for unauthorized actions, prompt injection attacks that engineer the prompt type and pattern, and data poisoning that affects model training. Finally, we discuss promising research directions in the future. We believe that our survey provides insights into the current landscape of LVLM vulnerabilities, inspiring more researchers to explore and mitigate potential safety issues in LVLM developments. The latest papers on LVLM attacks are continuously collected in https://github.com/liudaizong/Awesome-LVLM-Attack.

**Authors**: Ying Zhang, Xiaoyan Zhou, Hui Wen, Wenjia Niu, Jiqiang Liu, Haining Wang, Qiang Li

**Abstract**: Nowadays, the open-source software (OSS) ecosystem suffers from security threats of software supply chain (SSC) attacks. Interpreted OSS malware plays a vital role in SSC attacks, as criminals have an arsenal of attack vectors to deceive users into installing malware and executing malicious activities. In this paper, we introduce tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) proposed by MITRE ATT\&CK into the interpreted malware analysis to characterize different phases of an attack lifecycle. Specifically, we propose GENTTP, a zero-shot approach to extracting a TTP of an interpreted malware package. GENTTP leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate a TTP, where the input is a malicious package, and the output is a deceptive tactic and an execution tactic of attack vectors. To validate the effectiveness of GENTTP, we collect two datasets for evaluation: a dataset with ground truth labels and a large dataset in the wild. Experimental results show that GENTTP can generate TTPs with high accuracy and efficiency. To demonstrate GENTTP's benefits, we build an LLM-based Chatbot from 3,700+ PyPI malware's TTPs. We further conduct a quantitative analysis of malware's TTPs at a large scale. Our main findings include: (1) many OSS malicious packages share a relatively stable TTP, even with the increasing emergence of malware and attack campaigns, (2) a TTP reflects characteristics of a malware-based attack, and (3) an attacker's intent behind the malware is linked to a TTP.

**Authors**: Yuqi Zhou, Lin Lu, Hanchi Sun, Pan Zhou, Lichao Sun

**Abstract**: Jailbreak attacks on large language models (LLMs) involve inducing these models to generate harmful content that violates ethics or laws, posing a significant threat to LLM security. Current jailbreak attacks face two main challenges: low success rates due to defensive measures and high resource requirements for crafting specific prompts. This paper introduces Virtual Context, which leverages special tokens, previously overlooked in LLM security, to improve jailbreak attacks. Virtual Context addresses these challenges by significantly increasing the success rates of existing jailbreak methods and requiring minimal background knowledge about the target model, thus enhancing effectiveness in black-box settings without additional overhead. Comprehensive evaluations show that Virtual Context-assisted jailbreak attacks can improve the success rates of four widely used jailbreak methods by approximately 40% across various LLMs. Additionally, applying Virtual Context to original malicious behaviors still achieves a notable jailbreak effect. In summary, our research highlights the potential of special tokens in jailbreak attacks and recommends including this threat in red-teaming testing to comprehensively enhance LLM security.

**Abstract**: In this study, we conduct a comprehensive review of smart grid security, exploring system architectures, attack methodologies, defense strategies, and future research opportunities. We provide an in-depth analysis of various attack vectors, focusing on new attack surfaces introduced by advanced components in smart grids. The review particularly includes an extensive analysis of coordinated attacks that incorporate multiple attack strategies and exploit vulnerabilities across various smart grid components to increase their adverse impact, demonstrating the complexity and potential severity of these threats. Following this, we examine innovative detection and mitigation strategies, including game theory, graph theory, blockchain, and machine learning, discussing their advancements in counteracting evolving threats and associated research challenges. In particular, our review covers a thorough examination of widely used machine learning-based mitigation strategies, analyzing their applications and research challenges spanning across supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, ensemble, and reinforcement learning. Further, we outline future research directions and explore new techniques and concerns. We first discuss the research opportunities for existing and emerging strategies, and then explore the potential role of new techniques, such as large language models (LLMs), and the emerging threat of adversarial machine learning in the future of smart grid security.

**Authors**: Tianjie Ju, Yiting Wang, Xinbei Ma, Pengzhou Cheng, Haodong Zhao, Yulong Wang, Lifeng Liu, Jian Xie, Zhuosheng Zhang, Gongshen Liu

**Abstract**: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in multi-agent systems has highlighted their impressive capabilities in various applications, such as collaborative problem-solving and autonomous negotiation. However, the security implications of these LLM-based multi-agent systems have not been thoroughly investigated, particularly concerning the spread of manipulated knowledge. In this paper, we investigate this critical issue by constructing a detailed threat model and a comprehensive simulation environment that mirrors real-world multi-agent deployments in a trusted platform. Subsequently, we propose a novel two-stage attack method involving Persuasiveness Injection and Manipulated Knowledge Injection to systematically explore the potential for manipulated knowledge (i.e., counterfactual and toxic knowledge) spread without explicit prompt manipulation.   Our method leverages the inherent vulnerabilities of LLMs in handling world knowledge, which can be exploited by attackers to unconsciously spread fabricated information. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our attack method can successfully induce LLM-based agents to spread both counterfactual and toxic knowledge without degrading their foundational capabilities during agent communication. Furthermore, we show that these manipulations can persist through popular retrieval-augmented generation frameworks, where several benign agents store and retrieve manipulated chat histories for future interactions. This persistence indicates that even after the interaction has ended, the benign agents may continue to be influenced by manipulated knowledge. Our findings reveal significant security risks in LLM-based multi-agent systems, emphasizing the imperative need for robust defenses against manipulated knowledge spread, such as introducing ``guardian'' agents and advanced fact-checking tools.

**Authors**: Furkan Çolhak, Mert İlhan Ecevit, Hasan Dağ, Reiner Creutzburg

**Abstract**: The escalating landscape of cyber threats, characterized by the registration of thousands of new domains daily for large-scale Internet attacks such as spam, phishing, and drive-by downloads, underscores the imperative for innovative detection methodologies. This paper introduces a cutting-edge approach for identifying suspicious domains at the onset of the registration process. The accompanying data pipeline generates crucial features by comparing new domains to registered domains, emphasizing the crucial similarity score. The proposed system analyzes semantic and numerical attributes by leveraging a novel combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including a pretrained CANINE model and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models, providing a robust solution for early threat detection. This integrated Pretrained NLP (CANINE) + MLP model showcases the outstanding performance, surpassing both individual pretrained NLP models and standalone MLP models. With an F1 score of 84.86\% and an accuracy of 84.95\% on the SecureReg dataset, it effectively detects malicious domain registrations. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the integrated approach and contribute to the ongoing efforts to develop proactive strategies to mitigate the risks associated with illicit online activities through the early identification of suspicious domain registrations.

**Authors**: Simon Chi Lok Yu, Jie He, Pasquale Minervini, Jeff Z. Pan

**Abstract**: With the emergence of large language models, such as LLaMA and OpenAI GPT-3, In-Context Learning (ICL) gained significant attention due to its effectiveness and efficiency. However, ICL is very sensitive to the choice, order, and verbaliser used to encode the demonstrations in the prompt. Retrieval-Augmented ICL methods try to address this problem by leveraging retrievers to extract semantically related examples as demonstrations. While this approach yields more accurate results, its robustness against various types of adversarial attacks, including perturbations on test samples, demonstrations, and retrieved data, remains under-explored. Our study reveals that retrieval-augmented models can enhance robustness against test sample attacks, outperforming vanilla ICL with a 4.87% reduction in Attack Success Rate (ASR); however, they exhibit overconfidence in the demonstrations, leading to a 2% increase in ASR for demonstration attacks. Adversarial training can help improve the robustness of ICL methods to adversarial attacks; however, such a training scheme can be too costly in the context of LLMs. As an alternative, we introduce an effective training-free adversarial defence method, DARD, which enriches the example pool with those attacked samples. We show that DARD yields improvements in performance and robustness, achieving a 15% reduction in ASR over the baselines.

**Authors**: Adrians Skapars, Edoardo Manino, Youcheng Sun, Lucas C. Cordeiro

**Abstract**: Training large language models (LLMs) requires a substantial investment of time and money. To get a good return on investment, the developers spend considerable effort ensuring that the model never produces harmful and offensive outputs. However, bad-faith actors may still try to slander the reputation of an LLM by publicly reporting a forged output. In this paper, we show that defending against such slander attacks requires reconstructing the input of the forged output or proving that it does not exist. To do so, we propose and evaluate a search based approach for targeted adversarial attacks for LLMs. Our experiments show that we are rarely able to reconstruct the exact input of an arbitrary output, thus demonstrating that LLMs are still vulnerable to slander attacks.

**Abstract**: This paper comprehensively explores the ethical challenges arising from security threats to Large Language Models (LLMs). These intricate digital repositories are increasingly integrated into our daily lives, making them prime targets for attacks that can compromise their training data and the confidentiality of their data sources. The paper delves into the nuanced ethical repercussions of such security threats on society and individual privacy. We scrutinize five major threats--prompt injection, jailbreaking, Personal Identifiable Information (PII) exposure, sexually explicit content, and hate-based content--going beyond mere identification to assess their critical ethical consequences and the urgency they create for robust defensive strategies. The escalating reliance on LLMs underscores the crucial need for ensuring these systems operate within the bounds of ethical norms, particularly as their misuse can lead to significant societal and individual harm. We propose conceptualizing and developing an evaluative tool tailored for LLMs, which would serve a dual purpose: guiding developers and designers in preemptive fortification of backend systems and scrutinizing the ethical dimensions of LLM chatbot responses during the testing phase. By comparing LLM responses with those expected from humans in a moral context, we aim to discern the degree to which AI behaviors align with the ethical values held by a broader society. Ultimately, this paper not only underscores the ethical troubles presented by LLMs; it also highlights a path toward cultivating trust in these systems.

**Abstract**: Recent advances in neural information retrieval (IR) models have significantly enhanced their effectiveness over various IR tasks. The robustness of these models, essential for ensuring their reliability in practice, has also garnered significant attention. With a wide array of research on robust IR being proposed, we believe it is the opportune moment to consolidate the current status, glean insights from existing methodologies, and lay the groundwork for future development. We view the robustness of IR to be a multifaceted concept, emphasizing its necessity against adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and performance variance. With a focus on adversarial and OOD robustness, we dissect robustness solutions for dense retrieval models (DRMs) and neural ranking models (NRMs), respectively, recognizing them as pivotal components of the neural IR pipeline. We provide an in-depth discussion of existing methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics, shedding light on challenges and future directions in the era of large language models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey on the robustness of neural IR models, and we will also be giving our first tutorial presentation at SIGIR 2024 \url{https://sigir2024-robust-information-retrieval.github.io}. Along with the organization of existing work, we introduce a Benchmark for robust IR (BestIR), a heterogeneous evaluation benchmark for robust neural information retrieval, which is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Davion-Liu/BestIR}. We hope that this study provides useful clues for future research on the robustness of IR models and helps to develop trustworthy search engines \url{https://github.com/Davion-Liu/Awesome-Robustness-in-Information-Retrieval}.

**Abstract**: Many programs involves operations and logic manipulating user privileges, which is essential for the security of an organization. Therefore, one common malicious goal of attackers is to obtain or escalate the privileges, causing privilege leakage. To protect the program and the organization against privilege leakage attacks, it is important to eliminate the vulnerabilities which can be exploited to achieve such attacks. Unfortunately, while memory vulnerabilities are less challenging to find, logic vulnerabilities are much more imminent, harmful and difficult to identify. Accordingly, many analysts choose to find user privilege related (UPR) variables first as start points to investigate the code where the UPR variables may be used to see if there exists any vulnerabilities, especially the logic ones. In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM) workflow that can assist analysts in identifying such UPR variables, which is considered to be a very time-consuming task. Specifically, our tool will audit all the variables in a program and output a UPR score, which is the degree of relationship (closeness) between the variable and user privileges, for each variable. The proposed approach avoids the drawbacks introduced by directly prompting a LLM to find UPR variables by focusing on leverage the LLM at statement level instead of supplying LLM with very long code snippets. Those variables with high UPR scores are essentially potential UPR variables, which should be manually investigated. Our experiments show that using a typical UPR score threshold (i.e., UPR score >0.8), the false positive rate (FPR) is only 13.49%, while UPR variable found is significantly more than that of the heuristic based method.

**Abstract**: With the rise of deep learning in various applications, privacy concerns around the protection of training data have become a critical area of research. Whereas prior studies have focused on privacy risks in single-modal models, we introduce a novel method to assess privacy for multi-modal models, specifically vision-language models like CLIP. The proposed Identity Inference Attack (IDIA) reveals whether an individual was included in the training data by querying the model with images of the same person. Letting the model choose from a wide variety of possible text labels, the model reveals whether it recognizes the person and, therefore, was used for training. Our large-scale experiments on CLIP demonstrate that individuals used for training can be identified with very high accuracy. We confirm that the model has learned to associate names with depicted individuals, implying the existence of sensitive information that can be extracted by adversaries. Our results highlight the need for stronger privacy protection in large-scale models and suggest that IDIAs can be used to prove the unauthorized use of data for training and to enforce privacy laws.

**Abstract**: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by OpenAI's ChatGPT, brings to the forefront the imperative to defend against adversarial threats on these models. These attacks, which manipulate an LLM's output by introducing malicious inputs, undermine the model's integrity and the trust users place in its outputs. In response to this challenge, our paper presents an innovative defensive strategy, given white box access to an LLM, that harnesses residual activation analysis between transformer layers of the LLM. We apply a novel methodology for analyzing distinctive activation patterns in the residual streams for attack prompt classification. We curate multiple datasets to demonstrate how this method of classification has high accuracy across multiple types of attack scenarios, including our newly-created attack dataset. Furthermore, we enhance the model's resilience by integrating safety fine-tuning techniques for LLMs in order to measure its effect on our capability to detect attacks. The results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing the detection and mitigation of adversarial inputs, advancing the security framework within which LLMs operate.

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen widespread adoption due to their remarkable natural language capabilities. However, when deploying them in real-world settings, it is important to align LLMs to generate texts according to acceptable human standards. Methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have made significant progress in refining LLMs using human preference data. However, the privacy concerns inherent in utilizing such preference data have yet to be adequately studied. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of LLMs aligned using human preference datasets to membership inference attacks (MIAs), highlighting the shortcomings of previous MIA approaches with respect to preference data. Our study has two main contributions: first, we introduce a novel reference-based attack framework specifically for analyzing preference data called PREMIA (\uline{Pre}ference data \uline{MIA}); second, we provide empirical evidence that DPO models are more vulnerable to MIA compared to PPO models. Our findings highlight gaps in current privacy-preserving practices for LLM alignment.

**Authors**: Adriano Hernandez

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) sometimes exhibit dangerous unintended behaviors. Finding and fixing these is challenging because the attack surface is massive -- it is not tractable to exhaustively search for all possible inputs that may elicit such behavior. One specific and particularly challenging case is that if data-poisoning-injected trojans, since there is no way to know what they are to search for them. To our knowledge, there is no generally applicable method to unlearn unknown trojans injected during pre-training. This work seeks to provide a general purpose recipe (filters) and a specific implementation (LoRA) filters that work in practice on small to medium sized models. The focus is primarily empirical, though some perplexing behavior opens the door to the fundamental question of how LLMs store and process information. Not unexpectedly, we find that our filters work best on the residual stream and the latest layers.

**Authors**: Andy Zhou, Bo Li, Haohan Wang

**Abstract**: Despite advances in AI alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks or jailbreaking, in which adversaries can modify prompts to induce unwanted behavior. While some defenses have been proposed, they have not been adapted to newly proposed attacks and more challenging threat models. To address this, we propose an optimization-based objective for defending LLMs against jailbreaking attacks and an algorithm, Robust Prompt Optimization (RPO) to create robust system-level defenses. Our approach directly incorporates the adversary into the defensive objective and optimizes a lightweight and transferable suffix, enabling RPO to adapt to worst-case adaptive attacks. Our theoretical and experimental results show improved robustness to both jailbreaks seen during optimization and unknown jailbreaks, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) on GPT-4 to 6% and Llama-2 to 0% on JailbreakBench, setting the state-of-the-art.

**Authors**: Kaiyi Pang

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate general intelligence across a variety of machine learning tasks, thereby enhancing the commercial value of their intellectual property (IP). To protect this IP, model owners typically allow user access only in a black-box manner, however, adversaries can still utilize model extraction attacks to steal the model intelligence encoded in model generation. Watermarking technology offers a promising solution for defending against such attacks by embedding unique identifiers into the model-generated content. However, existing watermarking methods often compromise the quality of generated content due to heuristic alterations and lack robust mechanisms to counteract adversarial strategies, thus limiting their practicality in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive and robust watermarking method (named ModelShield) to protect the IP of LLMs. Our method incorporates a self-watermarking mechanism that allows LLMs to autonomously insert watermarks into their generated content to avoid the degradation of model content. We also propose a robust watermark detection mechanism capable of effectively identifying watermark signals under the interference of varying adversarial strategies. Besides, ModelShield is a plug-and-play method that does not require additional model training, enhancing its applicability in LLM deployments. Extensive evaluations on two real-world datasets and three LLMs demonstrate that our method surpasses existing methods in terms of defense effectiveness and robustness while significantly reducing the degradation of watermarking on the model-generated content.

**Abstract**: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has sparked widespread and general interest due to their strong language generation capabilities, offering great potential for both industry and research. While previous research delved into the security and privacy issues of LLMs, the extent to which these models can exhibit adversarial behavior remains largely unexplored. Addressing this gap, we investigate whether common publicly available LLMs have inherent capabilities to perturb text samples to fool safety measures, so-called adversarial examples resp.~attacks. More specifically, we investigate whether LLMs are inherently able to craft adversarial examples out of benign samples to fool existing safe rails. Our experiments, which focus on hate speech detection, reveal that LLMs succeed in finding adversarial perturbations, effectively undermining hate speech detection systems. Our findings carry significant implications for (semi-)autonomous systems relying on LLMs, highlighting potential challenges in their interaction with existing systems and safety measures.
