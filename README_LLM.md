Results for proposed scheme, additional/removal of content (figures  and equations), 12 pages

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-19    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02138v3) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02138v3)

**Abstract**: The indistinguishability of text generated by large language models (LLMs) from human-generated text poses significant challenges. Watermarking algorithms are potential solutions by embedding detectable signatures within LLM-generated outputs. However, current watermarking schemes lack robustness to a range of attacks such as text substitution or manipulation, undermining their reliability. This paper proposes a novel topic-based watermarking algorithm for LLMs, designed to enhance the robustness of watermarking in LLMs. Our approach leverages the topics extracted from input prompts or outputs of non-watermarked LLMs in the generation process of watermarked text. We dynamically utilize token lists on identified topics and adjust token sampling weights accordingly. By using these topic-specific token biases, we embed a topic-sensitive watermarking into the generated text. We outline the theoretical framework of our topic-based watermarking algorithm and discuss its potential advantages in various scenarios. Additionally, we explore a comprehensive range of attacks against watermarking algorithms, including discrete alterations, paraphrasing, and tokenizations. We demonstrate that our proposed watermarking scheme classifies various watermarked text topics with 99.99% confidence and outperforms existing algorithms in terms of z-score robustness and the feasibility of modeling text degradation by potential attackers, while considering the trade-offs between the benefits and losses of watermarking LLM-generated text.

**Abstract**: Privacy research has attracted wide attention as individuals worry that their private data can be easily leaked during interactions with smart devices, social platforms, and AI applications. Computer science researchers, on the other hand, commonly study privacy issues through privacy attacks and defenses on segmented fields. Privacy research is conducted on various sub-fields, including Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Computer Networks. Within each field, privacy has its own formulation. Though pioneering works on attacks and defenses reveal sensitive privacy issues, they are narrowly trapped and cannot fully cover people's actual privacy concerns. Consequently, the research on general and human-centric privacy research remains rather unexplored. In this paper, we formulate the privacy issue as a reasoning problem rather than simple pattern matching. We ground on the Contextual Integrity (CI) theory which posits that people's perceptions of privacy are highly correlated with the corresponding social context. Based on such an assumption, we develop the first comprehensive checklist that covers social identities, private attributes, and existing privacy regulations. Unlike prior works on CI that either cover limited expert annotated norms or model incomplete social context, our proposed privacy checklist uses the whole Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) as an example, to show that we can resort to large language models (LLMs) to completely cover the HIPAA's regulations. Additionally, our checklist also gathers expert annotations across multiple ontologies to determine private information including but not limited to personally identifiable information (PII). We use our preliminary results on the HIPAA to shed light on future context-centric privacy research to cover more privacy regulations, social norms and standards.

**Authors**: Pengzhou Cheng, Zongru Wu, Tianjie Ju, Wei Du, Zhuosheng Zhang Gongshen Liu

**Abstract**: Backdoor Attacks have been a serious vulnerability against Large Language Models (LLMs). However, previous methods only reveal such risk in specific models, or present tasks transferability after attacking the pre-trained phase. So, how risky is the model transferability of a backdoor attack? In this paper, we focus on whether existing mini-LLMs may be unconsciously instructed in backdoor knowledge by poisoned teacher LLMs through knowledge distillation (KD). Specifically, we propose ATBA, an adaptive transferable backdoor attack, which can effectively distill the backdoor of teacher LLMs into small models when only executing clean-tuning. We first propose the Target Trigger Generation (TTG) module that filters out a set of indicative trigger candidates from the token list based on cosine similarity distribution. Then, we exploit a shadow model to imitate the distilling process and introduce an Adaptive Trigger Optimization (ATO) module to realize a gradient-based greedy feedback to search optimal triggers. Extensive experiments show that ATBA generates not only positive guidance for student models but also implicitly transfers backdoor knowledge. Our attack is robust and stealthy, with over 80% backdoor transferability, and hopes the attention of security.



## **4. Bergeron: Combating Adversarial Attacks through a Conscience-Based Alignment Framework**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-18    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00029v3) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00029v3)

**Authors**: Matthew Pisano, Peter Ly, Abraham Sanders, Bingsheng Yao, Dakuo Wang, Tomek Strzalkowski, Mei Si

**Abstract**: Research into AI alignment has grown considerably since the recent introduction of increasingly capable Large Language Models (LLMs). Unfortunately, modern methods of alignment still fail to fully prevent harmful responses when models are deliberately attacked. Such vulnerabilities can lead to LLMs being manipulated into generating hazardous content: from instructions for creating dangerous materials to inciting violence or endorsing unethical behaviors. To help mitigate this issue, we introduce Bergeron: a framework designed to improve the robustness of LLMs against attacks without any additional parameter fine-tuning. Bergeron is organized into two tiers; with a secondary LLM acting as a guardian to the primary LLM. This framework better safeguards the primary model against incoming attacks while monitoring its output for any harmful content. Empirical analysis reviews that by using Bergeron to complement models with existing alignment training, we can significantly improve the robustness and safety of multiple, commonly used commercial and open-source LLMs. Specifically, we found that models integrated with Bergeron are, on average, nearly seven times more resistant to attacks compared to models without such support.



## **5. Antidote: Post-fine-tuning Safety Alignment for Large Language Models against Harmful Fine-tuning**

cs.AI

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-18    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09600v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09600v1)

**Authors**: Tiansheng Huang, Gautam Bhattacharya, Pratik Joshi, Josh Kimball, Ling Liu

**Abstract**: Safety aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to harmful fine-tuning attacks \cite{qi2023fine}-- a few harmful data mixed in the fine-tuning dataset can break the LLMs's safety alignment. Existing mitigation strategies include alignment stage solutions \cite{huang2024vaccine, rosati2024representation} and fine-tuning stage solutions \cite{huang2024lazy,mukhoti2023fine}. However, our evaluation shows that both categories of defenses fail \textit{when some specific training hyper-parameters are chosen} -- a large learning rate or a large number of training epochs in the fine-tuning stage can easily invalidate the defense, which however, is necessary to guarantee finetune performance. To this end, we propose Antidote, a post-fine-tuning stage solution, which remains \textbf{\textit{agnostic to the training hyper-parameters in the fine-tuning stage}}. Antidote relies on the philosophy that by removing the harmful parameters, the harmful model can be recovered from the harmful behaviors, regardless of how those harmful parameters are formed in the fine-tuning stage. With this philosophy, we introduce a one-shot pruning stage after harmful fine-tuning to remove the harmful weights that are responsible for the generation of harmful content. Despite its embarrassing simplicity, empirical results show that Antidote can reduce harmful score while maintaining accuracy on downstream tasks.



## **6. Characterizing and Evaluating the Reliability of LLMs against Jailbreak Attacks**

cs.CL

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-18    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09326v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09326v1)

**Authors**: Kexin Chen, Yi Liu, Dongxia Wang, Jiaying Chen, Wenhai Wang

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly become pivotal in content generation with notable societal impact. These models hold the potential to generate content that could be deemed harmful.Efforts to mitigate this risk include implementing safeguards to ensure LLMs adhere to social ethics.However, despite such measures, the phenomenon of "jailbreaking" -- where carefully crafted prompts elicit harmful responses from models -- persists as a significant challenge. Recognizing the continuous threat posed by jailbreaking tactics and their repercussions for the trustworthy use of LLMs, a rigorous assessment of the models' robustness against such attacks is essential. This study introduces an comprehensive evaluation framework and conducts an large-scale empirical experiment to address this need. We concentrate on 10 cutting-edge jailbreak strategies across three categories, 1525 questions from 61 specific harmful categories, and 13 popular LLMs. We adopt multi-dimensional metrics such as Attack Success Rate (ASR), Toxicity Score, Fluency, Token Length, and Grammatical Errors to thoroughly assess the LLMs' outputs under jailbreak. By normalizing and aggregating these metrics, we present a detailed reliability score for different LLMs, coupled with strategic recommendations to reduce their susceptibility to such vulnerabilities. Additionally, we explore the relationships among the models, attack strategies, and types of harmful content, as well as the correlations between the evaluation metrics, which proves the validity of our multifaceted evaluation framework. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate a lack of resilience among all tested LLMs against certain strategies, and highlight the need to concentrate on the reliability facets of LLMs. We believe our study can provide valuable insights into enhancing the security evaluation of LLMs against jailbreak within the domain.



## **7. BaThe: Defense against the Jailbreak Attack in Multimodal Large Language Models by Treating Harmful Instruction as Backdoor Trigger**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-17    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09093v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09093v1)

**Authors**: Yulin Chen, Haoran Li, Zihao Zheng, Yangqiu Song

**Abstract**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have showcased impressive performance in a variety of multimodal tasks. On the other hand, the integration of additional image modality may allow the malicious users to inject harmful content inside the images for jailbreaking. Unlike text-based LLMs, where adversaries need to select discrete tokens to conceal their malicious intent using specific algorithms, the continuous nature of image signals provides a direct opportunity for adversaries to inject harmful intentions. In this work, we propose $\textbf{BaThe}$ ($\textbf{Ba}$ckdoor $\textbf{T}$rigger S$\textbf{h}$i$\textbf{e}$ld), a simple yet effective jailbreak defense mechanism. Our work is motivated by recent research on jailbreak backdoor attack and virtual prompt backdoor attack in generative language models. Jailbreak backdoor attack uses harmful instructions combined with manually crafted strings as triggers to make the backdoored model generate prohibited responses. We assume that harmful instructions can function as triggers, and if we alternatively set rejection responses as the triggered response, the backdoored model then can defend against jailbreak attacks. We achieve this by utilizing virtual rejection prompt, similar to the virtual prompt backdoor attack. We embed the virtual rejection prompt into the soft text embeddings, which we call ``wedge''. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that BaThe effectively mitigates various types of jailbreak attacks and is adaptable to defend against unseen attacks, with minimal impact on MLLMs' performance.

**Abstract**: Knowledge editing has been increasingly adopted to correct the false or outdated knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs). Meanwhile, one critical but under-explored question is: can knowledge editing be used to inject harm into LLMs? In this paper, we propose to reformulate knowledge editing as a new type of safety threat for LLMs, namely Editing Attack, and conduct a systematic investigation with a newly constructed dataset EditAttack. Specifically, we focus on two typical safety risks of Editing Attack including Misinformation Injection and Bias Injection. For the risk of misinformation injection, we first categorize it into commonsense misinformation injection and long-tail misinformation injection. Then, we find that editing attacks can inject both types of misinformation into LLMs, and the effectiveness is particularly high for commonsense misinformation injection. For the risk of bias injection, we discover that not only can biased sentences be injected into LLMs with high effectiveness, but also one single biased sentence injection can cause a bias increase in general outputs of LLMs, which are even highly irrelevant to the injected sentence, indicating a catastrophic impact on the overall fairness of LLMs. Then, we further illustrate the high stealthiness of editing attacks, measured by their impact on the general knowledge and reasoning capacities of LLMs, and show the hardness of defending editing attacks with empirical evidence. Our discoveries demonstrate the emerging misuse risks of knowledge editing techniques on compromising the safety alignment of LLMs and the feasibility of disseminating misinformation or bias with LLMs as new channels.



## **9. Ask, Attend, Attack: A Effective Decision-Based Black-Box Targeted Attack for Image-to-Text Models**

cs.AI

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-16    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08989v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08989v1)

**Authors**: Qingyuan Zeng, Zhenzhong Wang, Yiu-ming Cheung, Min Jiang

**Abstract**: While image-to-text models have demonstrated significant advancements in various vision-language tasks, they remain susceptible to adversarial attacks. Existing white-box attacks on image-to-text models require access to the architecture, gradients, and parameters of the target model, resulting in low practicality. Although the recently proposed gray-box attacks have improved practicality, they suffer from semantic loss during the training process, which limits their targeted attack performance. To advance adversarial attacks of image-to-text models, this paper focuses on a challenging scenario: decision-based black-box targeted attacks where the attackers only have access to the final output text and aim to perform targeted attacks. Specifically, we formulate the decision-based black-box targeted attack as a large-scale optimization problem. To efficiently solve the optimization problem, a three-stage process \textit{Ask, Attend, Attack}, called \textit{AAA}, is proposed to coordinate with the solver. \textit{Ask} guides attackers to create target texts that satisfy the specific semantics. \textit{Attend} identifies the crucial regions of the image for attacking, thus reducing the search space for the subsequent \textit{Attack}. \textit{Attack} uses an evolutionary algorithm to attack the crucial regions, where the attacks are semantically related to the target texts of \textit{Ask}, thus achieving targeted attacks without semantic loss. Experimental results on transformer-based and CNN+RNN-based image-to-text models confirmed the effectiveness of our proposed \textit{AAA}.



## **10. Can Large Language Models Improve the Adversarial Robustness of Graph Neural Networks?**

cs.LG

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-16    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08685v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08685v1)

**Authors**: Zhongjian Zhang, Xiao Wang, Huichi Zhou, Yue Yu, Mengmei Zhang, Cheng Yang, Chuan Shi

**Abstract**: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, especially for topology attacks, and many methods that improve the robustness of GNNs have received considerable attention. Recently, we have witnessed the significant success of large language models (LLMs), leading many to explore the great potential of LLMs on GNNs. However, they mainly focus on improving the performance of GNNs by utilizing LLMs to enhance the node features. Therefore, we ask: Will the robustness of GNNs also be enhanced with the powerful understanding and inference capabilities of LLMs? By presenting the empirical results, we find that despite that LLMs can improve the robustness of GNNs, there is still an average decrease of 23.1% in accuracy, implying that the GNNs remain extremely vulnerable against topology attack. Therefore, another question is how to extend the capabilities of LLMs on graph adversarial robustness. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based robust graph structure inference framework, LLM4RGNN, which distills the inference capabilities of GPT-4 into a local LLM for identifying malicious edges and an LM-based edge predictor for finding missing important edges, so as to recover a robust graph structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLM4RGNN consistently improves the robustness across various GNNs. Even in some cases where the perturbation ratio increases to 40%, the accuracy of GNNs is still better than that on the clean graph.

**Authors**: Wenjie Fu, Huandong Wang, Chen Gao, Guanghua Liu, Yong Li, Tao Jiang

**Abstract**: The increasing parameters and expansive dataset of large language models (LLMs) highlight the urgent demand for a technical solution to audit the underlying privacy risks and copyright issues associated with LLMs. Existing studies have partially addressed this need through an exploration of the pre-training data detection problem, which is an instance of a membership inference attack (MIA). This problem involves determining whether a given piece of text has been used during the pre-training phase of the target LLM. Although existing methods have designed various sophisticated MIA score functions to achieve considerable detection performance in pre-trained LLMs, how to achieve high-confidence detection and how to perform MIA on aligned LLMs remain challenging. In this paper, we propose MIA-Tuner, a novel instruction-based MIA method, which instructs LLMs themselves to serve as a more precise pre-training data detector internally, rather than design an external MIA score function. Furthermore, we design two instruction-based safeguards to respectively mitigate the privacy risks brought by the existing methods and MIA-Tuner. To comprehensively evaluate the most recent state-of-the-art LLMs, we collect a more up-to-date MIA benchmark dataset, named WIKIMIA-24, to replace the widely adopted benchmark WIKIMIA. We conduct extensive experiments across various aligned and unaligned LLMs over the two benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that MIA-Tuner increases the AUC of MIAs from 0.7 to a significantly high level of 0.9.



## **12. Robust Neural Information Retrieval: An Adversarial and Out-of-distribution Perspective**

Survey paper

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-16    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06992v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06992v2)

**Authors**: Yu-An Liu, Ruqing Zhang, Jiafeng Guo, Maarten de Rijke, Yixing Fan, Xueqi Cheng

**Abstract**: Recent advances in neural information retrieval (IR) models have significantly enhanced their effectiveness over various IR tasks. The robustness of these models, essential for ensuring their reliability in practice, has also garnered significant attention. With a wide array of research on robust IR being proposed, we believe it is the opportune moment to consolidate the current status, glean insights from existing methodologies, and lay the groundwork for future development. We view the robustness of IR to be a multifaceted concept, emphasizing its necessity against adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and performance variance. With a focus on adversarial and OOD robustness, we dissect robustness solutions for dense retrieval models (DRMs) and neural ranking models (NRMs), respectively, recognizing them as pivotal components of the neural IR pipeline. We provide an in-depth discussion of existing methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics, shedding light on challenges and future directions in the era of large language models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey on the robustness of neural IR models, and we will also be giving our first tutorial presentation at SIGIR 2024 \url{https://sigir2024-robust-information-retrieval.github.io}. Along with the organization of existing work, we introduce a Benchmark for robust IR (BestIR), a heterogeneous evaluation benchmark for robust neural information retrieval, which is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Davion-Liu/BestIR}. We hope that this study provides useful clues for future research on the robustness of IR models and helps to develop trustworthy search engines \url{https://github.com/Davion-Liu/Awesome-Robustness-in-Information-Retrieval}.

**Authors**: Orson Mengara

**Abstract**: Since the advent of generative artificial intelligence, every company and researcher has been rushing to develop their own generative models, whether commercial or not. Given the large number of users of these powerful new tools, there is currently no intrinsically verifiable way to explain from the ground up what happens when LLMs (large language models) learn. For example, those based on automatic speech recognition systems, which have to rely on huge and astronomical amounts of data collected from all over the web to produce fast and efficient results, In this article, we develop a backdoor attack called MarketBackFinal 2.0, based on acoustic data poisoning, MarketBackFinal 2.0 is mainly based on modern stock market models. In order to show the possible vulnerabilities of speech-based transformers that may rely on LLMs.



## **14. ToolSword: Unveiling Safety Issues of Large Language Models in Tool Learning Across Three Stages**

Accepted by ACL 2024 Main Conference

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-16    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10753v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10753v2)

**Authors**: Junjie Ye, Sixian Li, Guanyu Li, Caishuang Huang, Songyang Gao, Yilong Wu, Qi Zhang, Tao Gui, Xuanjing Huang

**Abstract**: Tool learning is widely acknowledged as a foundational approach or deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world scenarios. While current research primarily emphasizes leveraging tools to augment LLMs, it frequently neglects emerging safety considerations tied to their application. To fill this gap, we present *ToolSword*, a comprehensive framework dedicated to meticulously investigating safety issues linked to LLMs in tool learning. Specifically, ToolSword delineates six safety scenarios for LLMs in tool learning, encompassing **malicious queries** and **jailbreak attacks** in the input stage, **noisy misdirection** and **risky cues** in the execution stage, and **harmful feedback** and **error conflicts** in the output stage. Experiments conducted on 11 open-source and closed-source LLMs reveal enduring safety challenges in tool learning, such as handling harmful queries, employing risky tools, and delivering detrimental feedback, which even GPT-4 is susceptible to. Moreover, we conduct further studies with the aim of fostering research on tool learning safety. The data is released in https://github.com/Junjie-Ye/ToolSword.



## **15. \textit{MMJ-Bench}: A Comprehensive Study on Jailbreak Attacks and Defenses for Vision Language Models**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-16    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08464v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08464v1)

**Authors**: Fenghua Weng, Yue Xu, Chengyan Fu, Wenjie Wang

**Abstract**: As deep learning advances, Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal counterparts, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), have shown exceptional performance in many real-world tasks. However, VLMs face significant security challenges, such as jailbreak attacks, where attackers attempt to bypass the model's safety alignment to elicit harmful responses. The threat of jailbreak attacks on VLMs arises from both the inherent vulnerabilities of LLMs and the multiple information channels that VLMs process. While various attacks and defenses have been proposed, there is a notable gap in unified and comprehensive evaluations, as each method is evaluated on different dataset and metrics, making it impossible to compare the effectiveness of each method. To address this gap, we introduce \textit{MMJ-Bench}, a unified pipeline for evaluating jailbreak attacks and defense techniques for VLMs. Through extensive experiments, we assess the effectiveness of various attack methods against SoTA VLMs and evaluate the impact of defense mechanisms on both defense effectiveness and model utility for normal tasks. Our comprehensive evaluation contribute to the field by offering a unified and systematic evaluation framework and the first public-available benchmark for VLM jailbreak research. We also demonstrate several insightful findings that highlights directions for future studies.



## **16. Trojan Activation Attack: Red-Teaming Large Language Models using Activation Steering for Safety-Alignment**

cs.CR

ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management  (CIKM'24)

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-15    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09433v3) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09433v3)

**Authors**: Haoran Wang, Kai Shu

**Abstract**: To ensure AI safety, instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) are specifically trained to ensure alignment, which refers to making models behave in accordance with human intentions. While these models have demonstrated commendable results on various safety benchmarks, the vulnerability of their safety alignment has not been extensively studied. This is particularly troubling given the potential harm that LLMs can inflict. Existing attack methods on LLMs often rely on poisoned training data or the injection of malicious prompts. These approaches compromise the stealthiness and generalizability of the attacks, making them susceptible to detection. Additionally, these models often demand substantial computational resources for implementation, making them less practical for real-world applications. In this work, we study a different attack scenario, called Trojan Activation Attack (TA^2), which injects trojan steering vectors into the activation layers of LLMs. These malicious steering vectors can be triggered at inference time to steer the models toward attacker-desired behaviors by manipulating their activations. Our experiment results on four primary alignment tasks show that TA^2 is highly effective and adds little or no overhead to attack efficiency. Additionally, we discuss potential countermeasures against such activation attacks.



## **17. Enhancing Data Privacy in Large Language Models through Private Association Editing**

cs.CL

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-15    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18221v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.18221v2)

**Authors**: Davide Venditti, Elena Sofia Ruzzetti, Giancarlo A. Xompero, Cristina Giannone, Andrea Favalli, Raniero Romagnoli, Fabio Massimo Zanzotto

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools with extensive applications, but their tendency to memorize private information raises significant concerns as private data leakage can easily happen. In this paper, we introduce Private Association Editing (PAE), a novel defense approach for private data leakage. PAE is designed to effectively remove Personally Identifiable Information (PII) without retraining the model. Our approach consists of a four-step procedure: detecting memorized PII, applying PAE cards to mitigate memorization of private data, verifying resilience to targeted data extraction (TDE) attacks, and ensuring consistency in the post-edit LLMs. The versatility and efficiency of PAE, which allows for batch modifications, significantly enhance data privacy in LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PAE in mitigating private data leakage. We believe PAE will serve as a critical tool in the ongoing effort to protect data privacy in LLMs, encouraging the development of safer models for real-world applications.

**Authors**: Shotaro Ishihara, Hiromu Takahashi

**Abstract**: Dominant pre-trained language models (PLMs) have demonstrated the potential risk of memorizing and outputting the training data. While this concern has been discussed mainly in English, it is also practically important to focus on domain-specific PLMs. In this study, we pre-trained domain-specific GPT-2 models using a limited corpus of Japanese newspaper articles and evaluated their behavior. Experiments replicated the empirical finding that memorization of PLMs is related to the duplication in the training data, model size, and prompt length, in Japanese the same as in previous English studies. Furthermore, we attempted membership inference attacks, demonstrating that the training data can be detected even in Japanese, which is the same trend as in English. The study warns that domain-specific PLMs, sometimes trained with valuable private data, can ''copy and paste'' on a large scale.



## **19. Prefix Guidance: A Steering Wheel for Large Language Models to Defend Against Jailbreak Attacks**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-15    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08924v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08924v1)

**Authors**: Jiawei Zhao, Kejiang Chen, Xiaojian Yuan, Weiming Zhang

**Abstract**: In recent years, the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable performance across various tasks. However, research indicates that LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where adversaries can induce the generation of harmful content through meticulously crafted prompts. This vulnerability poses significant challenges to the secure use and promotion of LLMs. Existing defense methods offer protection from different perspectives but often suffer from insufficient effectiveness or a significant impact on the model's capabilities. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play and easy-to-deploy jailbreak defense framework, namely Prefix Guidance (PG), which guides the model to identify harmful prompts by directly setting the first few tokens of the model's output. This approach combines the model's inherent security capabilities with an external classifier to defend against jailbreak attacks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PG across three models and five attack methods. Compared to baselines, our approach is generally more effective on average. Additionally, results on the Just-Eval benchmark further confirm PG's superiority to preserve the model's performance.



## **20. KGV: Integrating Large Language Models with Knowledge Graphs for Cyber Threat Intelligence Credibility Assessment**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-15    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08088v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08088v1)

**Authors**: Zongzong Wu, Fengxiao Tang, Ming Zhao, Yufeng Li

**Abstract**: Cyber threat intelligence is a critical tool that many organizations and individuals use to protect themselves from sophisticated, organized, persistent, and weaponized cyber attacks. However, few studies have focused on the quality assessment of threat intelligence provided by intelligence platforms, and this work still requires manual analysis by cybersecurity experts. In this paper, we propose a knowledge graph-based verifier, a novel Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) quality assessment framework that combines knowledge graphs and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach introduces LLMs to automatically extract OSCTI key claims to be verified and utilizes a knowledge graph consisting of paragraphs for fact-checking. This method differs from the traditional way of constructing complex knowledge graphs with entities as nodes. By constructing knowledge graphs with paragraphs as nodes and semantic similarity as edges, it effectively enhances the semantic understanding ability of the model and simplifies labeling requirements. Additionally, to fill the gap in the research field, we created and made public the first dataset for threat intelligence assessment from heterogeneous sources. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to create a dataset on threat intelligence reliability verification, providing a reference for future research. Experimental results show that KGV (Knowledge Graph Verifier) significantly improves the performance of LLMs in intelligence quality assessment. Compared with traditional methods, we reduce a large amount of data annotation while the model still exhibits strong reasoning capabilities. Finally, our method can achieve XXX accuracy in network threat assessment.

**Authors**: Guang Lin, Qibin Zhao

**Abstract**: Over the past two years, the use of large language models (LLMs) has advanced rapidly. While these LLMs offer considerable convenience, they also raise security concerns, as LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks by some well-designed textual perturbations. In this paper, we introduce a novel defense technique named Large LAnguage MOdel Sentinel (LLAMOS), which is designed to enhance the adversarial robustness of LLMs by purifying the adversarial textual examples before feeding them into the target LLM. Our method comprises two main components: a) Agent instruction, which can simulate a new agent for adversarial defense, altering minimal characters to maintain the original meaning of the sentence while defending against attacks; b) Defense guidance, which provides strategies for modifying clean or adversarial examples to ensure effective defense and accurate outputs from the target LLMs. Remarkably, the defense agent demonstrates robust defensive capabilities even without learning from adversarial examples. Additionally, we conduct an intriguing adversarial experiment where we develop two agents, one for defense and one for attack, and engage them in mutual confrontation. During the adversarial interactions, neither agent completely beat the other. Extensive experiments on both open-source and closed-source LLMs demonstrate that our method effectively defends against adversarial attacks, thereby enhancing adversarial robustness.

**Authors**: Ayush RoyChowdhury, Mulong Luo, Prateek Sahu, Sarbartha Banerjee, Mohit Tiwari

**Abstract**: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a process where a large language model (LLM) retrieves useful information from a database and then generates the responses. It is becoming popular in enterprise settings for daily business operations. For example, Copilot for Microsoft 365 has accumulated millions of businesses. However, the security implications of adopting such RAG-based systems are unclear.   In this paper, we introduce ConfusedPilot, a class of security vulnerabilities of RAG systems that confuse Copilot and cause integrity and confidentiality violations in its responses. First, we investigate a vulnerability that embeds malicious text in the modified prompt in RAG, corrupting the responses generated by the LLM. Second, we demonstrate a vulnerability that leaks secret data, which leverages the caching mechanism during retrieval. Third, we investigate how both vulnerabilities can be exploited to propagate misinformation within the enterprise and ultimately impact its operations, such as sales and manufacturing. We also discuss the root cause of these attacks by investigating the architecture of a RAG-based system. This study highlights the security vulnerabilities in today's RAG-based systems and proposes design guidelines to secure future RAG-based systems.

**Authors**: Quan Liu, Zhenhong Zhou, Longzhu He, Yi Liu, Wei Zhang, Sen Su

**Abstract**: Large language models are susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which can result in the generation of harmful content. While prior defenses mitigate these risks by perturbing or inspecting inputs, they ignore competing objectives, the underlying cause of alignment failures. In this paper, we propose Alignment-Enhanced Decoding (AED), a novel defense that employs adaptive decoding to address the root causes of jailbreak issues. We first define the Competitive Index to quantify alignment failures and utilize feedback from self-evaluation to compute post-alignment logits. Then, AED adaptively combines AED and post-alignment logits with the original logits to obtain harmless and helpful distributions. Consequently, our method enhances safety alignment while maintaining helpfulness. We conduct experiments across five models and four common jailbreaks, with the results validating the effectiveness of our approach. Code is available at https://github.com/GIGABaozi/AED.git.

**Authors**: Yiyang Luo, Ke Lin, Chao Gu

**Abstract**: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) in generating content raises concerns about text copyright. Watermarking methods, particularly logit-based approaches, embed imperceptible identifiers into text to address these challenges. However, the widespread usage of watermarking across diverse LLMs has led to an inevitable issue known as watermark collision during common tasks, such as paraphrasing or translation. In this paper, we introduce watermark collision as a novel and general philosophy for watermark attacks, aimed at enhancing attack performance on top of any other attacking methods. We also provide a comprehensive demonstration that watermark collision poses a threat to all logit-based watermark algorithms, impacting not only specific attack scenarios but also downstream applications.

**Abstract**: Automatically extracting personal information--such as name, phone number, and email address--from publicly available profiles at a large scale is a stepstone to many other security attacks including spear phishing. Traditional methods--such as regular expression, keyword search, and entity detection--achieve limited success at such personal information extraction. In this work, we perform a systematic measurement study to benchmark large language model (LLM) based personal information extraction and countermeasures. Towards this goal, we present a framework for LLM-based extraction attacks; collect three datasets including a synthetic dataset generated by GPT-4 and two real-world datasets with manually labeled 8 categories of personal information; introduce a novel mitigation strategy based on \emph{prompt injection}; and systematically benchmark LLM-based attacks and countermeasures using 10 LLMs and our 3 datasets. Our key findings include: LLM can be misused by attackers to accurately extract various personal information from personal profiles; LLM outperforms conventional methods at such extraction; and prompt injection can mitigate such risk to a large extent and outperforms conventional countermeasures.

**Authors**: Shi Lin, Rongchang Li, Xun Wang, Changting Lin, Wenpeng Xing, Meng Han

**Abstract**: The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought remarkable generative capabilities across diverse tasks. However, despite the impressive achievements, these LLMs still have numerous inherent vulnerabilities, particularly when faced with jailbreak attacks. By investigating jailbreak attacks, we can uncover hidden weaknesses in LLMs and inform the development of more robust defense mechanisms to fortify their security. In this paper, we further explore the boundary of jailbreak attacks on LLMs and propose Analyzing-based Jailbreak (ABJ). This effective jailbreak attack method takes advantage of LLMs' growing analyzing and reasoning capability and reveals their underlying vulnerabilities when facing analyzing-based tasks. We conduct a detailed evaluation of ABJ across various open-source and closed-source LLMs, which achieves 94.8% attack success rate (ASR) and 1.06 attack efficiency (AE) on GPT-4-turbo-0409, demonstrating state-of-the-art attack effectiveness and efficiency. Our research highlights the importance of prioritizing and enhancing the safety of LLMs to mitigate the risks of misuse. The code is publicly available at hhttps://github.com/theshi-1128/ABJ-Attack.

**Authors**: Wei Zou, Runpeng Geng, Binghui Wang, Jinyuan Jia

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success due to their exceptional generative capabilities. Despite their success, they also have inherent limitations such as a lack of up-to-date knowledge and hallucination. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a state-of-the-art technique to mitigate these limitations. The key idea of RAG is to ground the answer generation of an LLM on external knowledge retrieved from a knowledge database. Existing studies mainly focus on improving the accuracy or efficiency of RAG, leaving its security largely unexplored. We aim to bridge the gap in this work. We find that the knowledge database in a RAG system introduces a new and practical attack surface. Based on this attack surface, we propose PoisonedRAG, the first knowledge corruption attack to RAG, where an attacker could inject a few malicious texts into the knowledge database of a RAG system to induce an LLM to generate an attacker-chosen target answer for an attacker-chosen target question. We formulate knowledge corruption attacks as an optimization problem, whose solution is a set of malicious texts. Depending on the background knowledge (e.g., black-box and white-box settings) of an attacker on a RAG system, we propose two solutions to solve the optimization problem, respectively. Our results show PoisonedRAG could achieve a 90% attack success rate when injecting five malicious texts for each target question into a knowledge database with millions of texts. We also evaluate several defenses and our results show they are insufficient to defend against PoisonedRAG, highlighting the need for new defenses.

**Authors**: Sampath Rajapaksha, Ruby Rani, Erisa Karafili

**Abstract**: In the constantly evolving field of cybersecurity, it is imperative for analysts to stay abreast of the latest attack trends and pertinent information that aids in the investigation and attribution of cyber-attacks. In this work, we introduce the first question-answering (QA) model and its application that provides information to the cybersecurity experts about cyber-attacks investigations and attribution. Our QA model is based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques together with a Large Language Model (LLM) and provides answers to the users' queries based on either our knowledge base (KB) that contains curated information about cyber-attacks investigations and attribution or on outside resources provided by the users. We have tested and evaluated our QA model with various types of questions, including KB-based, metadata-based, specific documents from the KB, and external sources-based questions. We compared the answers for KB-based questions with those from OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and the latest GPT-4o LLMs. Our proposed QA model outperforms OpenAI's GPT models by providing the source of the answers and overcoming the hallucination limitations of the GPT models, which is critical for cyber-attack investigation and attribution. Additionally, our analysis showed that when the RAG QA model is given few-shot examples rather than zero-shot instructions, it generates better answers compared to cases where no examples are supplied in addition to the query.

**Authors**: Dang Huu-Tien, Trung-Tin Pham, Hoang Thanh-Tung, Naoya Inoue

**Abstract**: Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (RMU), which steers model representation in the intermediate layer to a target random representation, is an effective method for large language model (LLM) unlearning. Despite its high performance, the underlying cause and explanation remain underexplored. In this paper, we first theoretically demonstrate that steering forget representations in the intermediate layer reduces token confidence, causing LLMs to generate wrong or nonsense responses. Second, we investigate how the coefficient influences the alignment of forget-sample representations with the random direction and hint at the optimal coefficient values for effective unlearning across different network layers. Third, we show that RMU unlearned models are robust against adversarial jailbreak attacks. Last, our empirical analysis shows that RMU is less effective when applied to the middle and later layers in LLMs. To resolve this drawback, we propose Adaptive RMU -- a simple yet effective alternative method that makes unlearning effective with most layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Adaptive RMU significantly improves the unlearning performance compared to prior art while incurring no additional computational cost.

**Authors**: Cédric Eichler, Nathan Champeil, Nicolas Anciaux, Alexandra Bensamoun, Heber Hwang Arcolezi, José Maria De Fuentes

**Abstract**: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has triggered legal and ethical concerns, especially regarding the unauthorized use of copyrighted materials in their training datasets. This has led to lawsuits against tech companies accused of using protected content without permission. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) aim to detect whether specific documents were used in a given LLM pretraining, but their effectiveness is undermined by biases such as time-shifts and n-gram overlaps.   This paper addresses the evaluation of MIAs on LLMs with partially inferable training sets, under the ex-post hypothesis, which acknowledges inherent distributional biases between members and non-members datasets. We propose and validate algorithms to create ``non-biased'' and ``non-classifiable'' datasets for fairer MIA assessment. Experiments using the Gutenberg dataset on OpenLamma and Pythia show that neutralizing known biases alone is insufficient. Our methods produce non-biased ex-post datasets with AUC-ROC scores comparable to those previously obtained on genuinely random datasets, validating our approach. Globally, MIAs yield results close to random, with only one being effective on both random and our datasets, but its performance decreases when bias is removed.

**Authors**: Jehyun Lee, Peiyuan Lim, Bryan Hooi, Dinil Mon Divakaran

**Abstract**: To address the challenging problem of detecting phishing webpages, researchers have developed numerous solutions, in particular those based on machine learning (ML) algorithms. Among these, brand-based phishing detection that uses models from Computer Vision to detect if a given webpage is imitating a well-known brand has received widespread attention. However, such models are costly and difficult to maintain, as they need to be retrained with labeled dataset that has to be regularly and continuously collected. Besides, they also need to maintain a good reference list of well-known websites and related meta-data for effective performance.   In this work, we take steps to study the efficacy of large language models (LLMs), in particular the multimodal LLMs, in detecting phishing webpages. Given that the LLMs are pretrained on a large corpus of data, we aim to make use of their understanding of different aspects of a webpage (logo, theme, favicon, etc.) to identify the brand of a given webpage and compare the identified brand with the domain name in the URL to detect a phishing attack. We propose a two-phase system employing LLMs in both phases: the first phase focuses on brand identification, while the second verifies the domain. We carry out comprehensive evaluations on a newly collected dataset. Our experiments show that the LLM-based system achieves a high detection rate at high precision; importantly, it also provides interpretable evidence for the decisions. Our system also performs significantly better than a state-of-the-art brand-based phishing detection system while demonstrating robustness against two known adversarial attacks.

**Authors**: Sina Gholamian, Gianfranco Romani, Bartosz Rudnikowicz, Laura Skylaki

**Abstract**: Product classification is a crucial task in international trade, as compliance regulations are verified and taxes and duties are applied based on product categories. Manual classification of products is time-consuming and error-prone, and the sheer volume of products imported and exported renders the manual process infeasible. Consequently, e-commerce platforms and enterprises involved in international trade have turned to automatic product classification using machine learning. However, current approaches do not consider the real-world challenges associated with product classification, such as very abbreviated and incomplete product descriptions. In addition, recent advancements in generative Large Language Models (LLMs) and their reasoning capabilities are mainly untapped in product classification and e-commerce. In this research, we explore the real-life challenges of industrial classification and we propose data perturbations that allow for realistic data simulation. Furthermore, we employ LLM-based product classification to improve the robustness of the prediction in presence of incomplete data. Our research shows that LLMs with in-context learning outperform the supervised approaches in the clean-data scenario. Additionally, we illustrate that LLMs are significantly more robust than the supervised approaches when data attacks are present.

**Authors**: Robert J. Moss

**Abstract**: Eliciting harmful behavior from large language models (LLMs) is an important task to ensure the proper alignment and safety of the models. Often when training LLMs, ethical guidelines are followed yet alignment failures may still be uncovered through red teaming adversarial attacks. This work frames the red-teaming problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and uses Monte Carlo tree search to find harmful behaviors of black-box, closed-source LLMs. We optimize token-level prompt suffixes towards targeted harmful behaviors on white-box LLMs and include a naturalistic loss term, log-perplexity, to generate more natural language attacks for better interpretability. The proposed algorithm, Kov, trains on white-box LLMs to optimize the adversarial attacks and periodically evaluates responses from the black-box LLM to guide the search towards more harmful black-box behaviors. In our preliminary study, results indicate that we can jailbreak black-box models, such as GPT-3.5, in only 10 queries, yet fail on GPT-4$-$which may indicate that newer models are more robust to token-level attacks. All work to reproduce these results is open sourced (https://github.com/sisl/Kov.jl).

**Authors**: Renascence Tarafder Prapty, Ashish Kundu, Arun Iyengar

**Abstract**: As the complexity of modern systems increases, so does the importance of assessing their security posture through effective vulnerability management and threat modeling techniques. One powerful tool in the arsenal of cybersecurity professionals is the attack graph, a representation of all potential attack paths within a system that an adversary might exploit to achieve a certain objective. Traditional methods of generating attack graphs involve expert knowledge, manual curation, and computational algorithms that might not cover the entire threat landscape due to the ever-evolving nature of vulnerabilities and exploits. This paper explores the approach of leveraging large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, to automate the generation of attack graphs by intelligently chaining Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) based on their preconditions and effects. It also shows how to utilize LLMs to create attack graphs from threat reports.

**Authors**: Hong Wang, Xuan Luo, Weizhi Wang, Xifeng Yan

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. However, there is a concern that they can be misused for malicious purposes, such as fraud or denial-of-service attacks. Therefore, it is crucial to develop methods for detecting whether the party involved in a conversation is a bot or a human. In this paper, we propose a framework named FLAIR, Finding Large Language Model Authenticity via a Single Inquiry and Response, to detect conversational bots in an online manner. Specifically, we target a single question scenario that can effectively differentiate human users from bots. The questions are divided into two categories: those that are easy for humans but difficult for bots (e.g., counting, substitution, searching, and ASCII art reasoning), and those that are easy for bots but difficult for humans (e.g., memorization and computation). Our approach shows different strengths of these questions in their effectiveness, providing a new way for online service providers to protect themselves against nefarious activities. Our code and question set are available at https://github.com/hongwang600/FLAIR.

**Authors**: Yihe Fan, Yuxin Cao, Ziyu Zhao, Ziyao Liu, Shaofeng Li

**Abstract**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities that increasingly influence various aspects of our daily lives, constantly defining the new boundary of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Image modalities, enriched with profound semantic information and a more continuous mathematical nature compared to other modalities, greatly enhance the functionalities of MLLMs when integrated. However, this integration serves as a double-edged sword, providing attackers with expansive vulnerabilities to exploit for highly covert and harmful attacks. The pursuit of reliable AI systems like powerful MLLMs has emerged as a pivotal area of contemporary research. In this paper, we endeavor to demostrate the multifaceted risks associated with the incorporation of image modalities into MLLMs. Initially, we delineate the foundational components and training processes of MLLMs. Subsequently, we construct a threat model, outlining the security vulnerabilities intrinsic to MLLMs. Moreover, we analyze and summarize existing scholarly discourses on MLLMs' attack and defense mechanisms, culminating in suggestions for the future research on MLLM security. Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to deepen the academic understanding of MLLM security challenges and propel forward the development of trustworthy MLLM systems.

**Authors**: Sayak Saha Roy, Shirin Nilizadeh

**Abstract**: In this paper, we introduce PhishLang, an open-source, lightweight Large Language Model (LLM) specifically designed for phishing website detection through contextual analysis of the website. Unlike traditional heuristic or machine learning models that rely on static features and struggle to adapt to new threats and deep learning models that are computationally intensive, our model utilizes the advanced language processing capabilities of LLMs to learn granular features that are characteristic of phishing attacks. Furthermore, PhishLang operates with minimal data preprocessing and offers performance comparable to leading deep learning tools, while being significantly faster and less resource-intensive. Over a 3.5-month testing period, PhishLang successfully identified approximately 26K phishing URLs, many of which were undetected by popular antiphishing blocklists, thus demonstrating its potential to aid current detection measures. We also evaluate PhishLang against several realistic adversarial attacks and develop six patches that make it very robust against such threats. Furthermore, we integrate PhishLang with GPT-3.5 Turbo to create \textit{explainable blocklisting} - warnings that provide users with contextual information about different features that led to a website being marked as phishing. Finally, we have open-sourced the PhishLang framework and developed a Chromium-based browser extension and URL scanner website, which implement explainable warnings for end-users.

**Authors**: Michele Miranda, Elena Sofia Ruzzetti, Andrea Santilli, Fabio Massimo Zanzotto, Sébastien Bratières, Emanuele Rodolà

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, finding applications across various domains. However, their reliance on massive internet-sourced datasets for training brings notable privacy issues, which are exacerbated in critical domains (e.g., healthcare). Moreover, certain application-specific scenarios may require fine-tuning these models on private data. This survey critically examines the privacy threats associated with LLMs, emphasizing the potential for these models to memorize and inadvertently reveal sensitive information. We explore current threats by reviewing privacy attacks on LLMs and propose comprehensive solutions for integrating privacy mechanisms throughout the entire learning pipeline. These solutions range from anonymizing training datasets to implementing differential privacy during training or inference and machine unlearning after training. Our comprehensive review of existing literature highlights ongoing challenges, available tools, and future directions for preserving privacy in LLMs. This work aims to guide the development of more secure and trustworthy AI systems by providing a thorough understanding of privacy preservation methods and their effectiveness in mitigating risks.

**Authors**: Xiaojing Fan, Chunliang Tao

**Abstract**: With the increasing demand for practical applications of Large Language Models (LLMs), many attention-efficient models have been developed to balance performance and computational cost. However, the adversarial robustness of these models remains under-explored. In this work, we design a framework to investigate the trade-off between efficiency, performance, and adversarial robustness of LLMs by comparing three prominent models with varying levels of complexity and efficiency -- Transformer++, Gated Linear Attention (GLA) Transformer, and MatMul-Free LM -- utilizing the GLUE and AdvGLUE datasets. The AdvGLUE dataset extends the GLUE dataset with adversarial samples designed to challenge model robustness. Our results show that while the GLA Transformer and MatMul-Free LM achieve slightly lower accuracy on GLUE tasks, they demonstrate higher efficiency and either superior or comparative robustness on AdvGLUE tasks compared to Transformer++ across different attack levels. These findings highlight the potential of simplified architectures to achieve a compelling balance between efficiency, performance, and adversarial robustness, offering valuable insights for applications where resource constraints and resilience to adversarial attacks are critical.

**Authors**: Pritam Deka, Sampath Rajapaksha, Ruby Rani, Amirah Almutairi, Erisa Karafili

**Abstract**: Cyber-attack attribution is an important process that allows experts to put in place attacker-oriented countermeasures and legal actions. The analysts mainly perform attribution manually, given the complex nature of this task. AI and, more specifically, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be leveraged to support cybersecurity analysts during the attribution process. However powerful these techniques are, they need to deal with the lack of datasets in the attack attribution domain. In this work, we will fill this gap and will provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first dataset on cyber-attack attribution. We designed our dataset with the primary goal of extracting attack attribution information from cybersecurity texts, utilizing named entity recognition (NER) methodologies from the field of NLP. Unlike other cybersecurity NER datasets, ours offers a rich set of annotations with contextual details, including some that span phrases and sentences. We conducted extensive experiments and applied NLP techniques to demonstrate the dataset's effectiveness for attack attribution. These experiments highlight the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) capabilities to improve the NER tasks in cybersecurity datasets for cyber-attack attribution.

**Authors**: Parisa Farmanifard, Arun Ross

**Abstract**: This study utilizes the advanced capabilities of the GPT-4 multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) to explore its potential in iris recognition - a field less common and more specialized than face recognition. By focusing on this niche yet crucial area, we investigate how well AI tools like ChatGPT can understand and analyze iris images. Through a series of meticulously designed experiments employing a zero-shot learning approach, the capabilities of ChatGPT-4 was assessed across various challenging conditions including diverse datasets, presentation attacks, occlusions such as glasses, and other real-world variations. The findings convey ChatGPT-4's remarkable adaptability and precision, revealing its proficiency in identifying distinctive iris features, while also detecting subtle effects like makeup on iris recognition. A comparative analysis with Gemini Advanced - Google's AI model - highlighted ChatGPT-4's better performance and user experience in complex iris analysis tasks.

**Authors**: Moussa Koulako Bala Doumbouya, Ananjan Nandi, Gabriel Poesia, Davide Ghilardi, Anna Goldie, Federico Bianchi, Dan Jurafsky, Christopher D. Manning

**Abstract**: The safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a critical concern due to a lack of adequate benchmarks for systematically evaluating their ability to resist generating harmful content. Previous efforts towards automated red teaming involve static or templated sets of illicit requests and adversarial prompts which have limited utility given jailbreak attacks' evolving and composable nature. We propose a novel dynamic benchmark of composable jailbreak attacks to move beyond static datasets and taxonomies of attacks and harms. Our approach consists of three components collectively called h4rm3l: (1) a domain-specific language that formally expresses jailbreak attacks as compositions of parameterized prompt transformation primitives, (2) bandit-based few-shot program synthesis algorithms that generate novel attacks optimized to penetrate the safety filters of a target black box LLM, and (3) open-source automated red-teaming software employing the previous two components. We use h4rm3l to generate a dataset of 2656 successful novel jailbreak attacks targeting 6 state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source and proprietary LLMs. Several of our synthesized attacks are more effective than previously reported ones, with Attack Success Rates exceeding 90% on SOTA closed language models such as claude-3-haiku and GPT4-o. By generating datasets of jailbreak attacks in a unified formal representation, h4rm3l enables reproducible benchmarking and automated red-teaming, contributes to understanding LLM safety limitations, and supports the development of robust defenses in an increasingly LLM-integrated world.   Warning: This paper and related research artifacts contain offensive and potentially disturbing prompts and model-generated content.

**Abstract**: Rapid advances in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have raised widespread concerns regarding their potential for malicious use. Open-weight LLMs present unique challenges, as existing safeguards lack robustness to tampering attacks that modify model weights. For example, recent works have demonstrated that refusal and unlearning safeguards can be trivially removed with a few steps of fine-tuning. These vulnerabilities necessitate new approaches for enabling the safe release of open-weight LLMs. We develop a method, called TAR, for building tamper-resistant safeguards into open-weight LLMs such that adversaries cannot remove the safeguards even after thousands of steps of fine-tuning. In extensive evaluations and red teaming analyses, we find that our method greatly improves tamper-resistance while preserving benign capabilities. Our results demonstrate that tamper-resistance is a tractable problem, opening up a promising new avenue to improve the safety and security of open-weight LLMs.

**Authors**: Stanislav Fort, Balaji Lakshminarayanan

**Abstract**: Adversarial examples pose a significant challenge to the robustness, reliability and alignment of deep neural networks. We propose a novel, easy-to-use approach to achieving high-quality representations that lead to adversarial robustness through the use of multi-resolution input representations and dynamic self-ensembling of intermediate layer predictions. We demonstrate that intermediate layer predictions exhibit inherent robustness to adversarial attacks crafted to fool the full classifier, and propose a robust aggregation mechanism based on Vickrey auction that we call \textit{CrossMax} to dynamically ensemble them. By combining multi-resolution inputs and robust ensembling, we achieve significant adversarial robustness on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets without any adversarial training or extra data, reaching an adversarial accuracy of $\approx$72% (CIFAR-10) and $\approx$48% (CIFAR-100) on the RobustBench AutoAttack suite ($L_\infty=8/255)$ with a finetuned ImageNet-pretrained ResNet152. This represents a result comparable with the top three models on CIFAR-10 and a +5 % gain compared to the best current dedicated approach on CIFAR-100. Adding simple adversarial training on top, we get $\approx$78% on CIFAR-10 and $\approx$51% on CIFAR-100, improving SOTA by 5 % and 9 % respectively and seeing greater gains on the harder dataset. We validate our approach through extensive experiments and provide insights into the interplay between adversarial robustness, and the hierarchical nature of deep representations. We show that simple gradient-based attacks against our model lead to human-interpretable images of the target classes as well as interpretable image changes. As a byproduct, using our multi-resolution prior, we turn pre-trained classifiers and CLIP models into controllable image generators and develop successful transferable attacks on large vision language models.



## **45. Duwak: Dual Watermarks in Large Language Models**

**Authors**: Chaoyi Zhu, Jeroen Galjaard, Pin-Yu Chen, Lydia Y. Chen

**Abstract**: As large language models (LLM) are increasingly used for text generation tasks, it is critical to audit their usages, govern their applications, and mitigate their potential harms. Existing watermark techniques are shown effective in embedding single human-imperceptible and machine-detectable patterns without significantly affecting generated text quality and semantics. However, the efficiency in detecting watermarks, i.e., the minimum number of tokens required to assert detection with significance and robustness against post-editing, is still debatable. In this paper, we propose, Duwak, to fundamentally enhance the efficiency and quality of watermarking by embedding dual secret patterns in both token probability distribution and sampling schemes. To mitigate expression degradation caused by biasing toward certain tokens, we design a contrastive search to watermark the sampling scheme, which minimizes the token repetition and enhances the diversity. We theoretically explain the interdependency of the two watermarks within Duwak. We evaluate Duwak extensively on Llama2 under various post-editing attacks, against four state-of-the-art watermarking techniques and combinations of them. Our results show that Duwak marked text achieves the highest watermarked text quality at the lowest required token count for detection, up to 70% tokens less than existing approaches, especially under post paraphrasing.



## **46. Towards Explainable Network Intrusion Detection using Large Language Models**

**Authors**: Paul R. B. Houssel, Priyanka Singh, Siamak Layeghy, Marius Portmann

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionised natural language processing tasks, particularly as chat agents. However, their applicability to threat detection problems remains unclear. This paper examines the feasibility of employing LLMs as a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS), despite their high computational requirements, primarily for the sake of explainability. Furthermore, considerable resources have been invested in developing LLMs, and they may offer utility for NIDS. Current state-of-the-art NIDS rely on artificial benchmarking datasets, resulting in skewed performance when applied to real-world networking environments. Therefore, we compare the GPT-4 and LLama3 models against traditional architectures and transformer-based models to assess their ability to detect malicious NetFlows without depending on artificially skewed datasets, but solely on their vast pre-trained acquired knowledge. Our results reveal that, although LLMs struggle with precise attack detection, they hold significant potential for a path towards explainable NIDS. Our preliminary exploration shows that LLMs are unfit for the detection of Malicious NetFlows. Most promisingly, however, these exhibit significant potential as complementary agents in NIDS, particularly in providing explanations and aiding in threat response when integrated with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and function calling capabilities.

**Authors**: Xiongtao Sun, Deyue Zhang, Dongdong Yang, Quanchen Zou, Hui Li

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the performance of numerous applications, from intelligent conversations to text generation. However, their inherent security vulnerabilities have become an increasingly significant challenge, especially with respect to jailbreak attacks. Attackers can circumvent the security mechanisms of these LLMs, breaching security constraints and causing harmful outputs. Focusing on multi-turn semantic jailbreak attacks, we observe that existing methods lack specific considerations for the role of multiturn dialogues in attack strategies, leading to semantic deviations during continuous interactions. Therefore, in this paper, we establish a theoretical foundation for multi-turn attacks by considering their support in jailbreak attacks, and based on this, propose a context-based contextual fusion black-box jailbreak attack method, named Context Fusion Attack (CFA). This method approach involves filtering and extracting key terms from the target, constructing contextual scenarios around these terms, dynamically integrating the target into the scenarios, replacing malicious key terms within the target, and thereby concealing the direct malicious intent. Through comparisons on various mainstream LLMs and red team datasets, we have demonstrated CFA's superior success rate, divergence, and harmfulness compared to other multi-turn attack strategies, particularly showcasing significant advantages on Llama3 and GPT-4.



## **48. Effective Prompt Extraction from Language Models**

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-07    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06865v3) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06865v3)

**Authors**: Yiming Zhang, Nicholas Carlini, Daphne Ippolito

**Abstract**: The text generated by large language models is commonly controlled by prompting, where a prompt prepended to a user's query guides the model's output. The prompts used by companies to guide their models are often treated as secrets, to be hidden from the user making the query. They have even been treated as commodities to be bought and sold on marketplaces. However, anecdotal reports have shown adversarial users employing prompt extraction attacks to recover these prompts. In this paper, we present a framework for systematically measuring the effectiveness of these attacks. In experiments with 3 different sources of prompts and 11 underlying large language models, we find that simple text-based attacks can in fact reveal prompts with high probability. Our framework determines with high precision whether an extracted prompt is the actual secret prompt, rather than a model hallucination. Prompt extraction from real systems such as Claude 3 and ChatGPT further suggest that system prompts can be revealed by an adversary despite existing defenses in place.

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled at language understanding and generating human-level text. However, even with supervised training and human alignment, these LLMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks where malicious users can prompt the model to generate undesirable text. LLMs also inherently encode potential biases that can cause various harmful effects during interactions. Bias evaluation metrics lack standards as well as consensus and existing methods often rely on human-generated templates and annotations which are expensive and labor intensive. In this work, we train models to automatically create adversarial prompts to elicit biased responses from target LLMs. We present LLM- based bias evaluation metrics and also analyze several existing automatic evaluation methods and metrics. We analyze the various nuances of model responses, identify the strengths and weaknesses of model families, and assess where evaluation methods fall short. We compare these metrics to human evaluation and validate that the LLM-as-a-Judge metric aligns with human judgement on bias in response generation.



## **50. EnJa: Ensemble Jailbreak on Large Language Models**

**Authors**: Jiahao Zhang, Zilong Wang, Ruofan Wang, Xingjun Ma, Yu-Gang Jiang

**Abstract**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in safety-critical applications, their vulnerability to potential jailbreaks -- malicious prompts that can disable the safety mechanism of LLMs -- has attracted growing research attention. While alignment methods have been proposed to protect LLMs from jailbreaks, many have found that aligned LLMs can still be jailbroken by carefully crafted malicious prompts, producing content that violates policy regulations. Existing jailbreak attacks on LLMs can be categorized into prompt-level methods which make up stories/logic to circumvent safety alignment and token-level attack methods which leverage gradient methods to find adversarial tokens. In this work, we introduce the concept of Ensemble Jailbreak and explore methods that can integrate prompt-level and token-level jailbreak into a more powerful hybrid jailbreak attack. Specifically, we propose a novel EnJa attack to hide harmful instructions using prompt-level jailbreak, boost the attack success rate using a gradient-based attack, and connect the two types of jailbreak attacks via a template-based connector. We evaluate the effectiveness of EnJa on several aligned models and show that it achieves a state-of-the-art attack success rate with fewer queries and is much stronger than any individual jailbreak.
