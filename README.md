cs.CV

Accepted at WACV 2023 (Round 1)

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-20    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.09883v1)

**Authors**: Abhishek Aich, Shasha Li, Chengyu Song, M. Salman Asif, Srikanth V. Krishnamurthy, Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury

**Abstracts**: State-of-the-art generative model-based attacks against image classifiers overwhelmingly focus on single-object (i.e., single dominant object) images. Different from such settings, we tackle a more practical problem of generating adversarial perturbations using multi-object (i.e., multiple dominant objects) images as they are representative of most real-world scenes. Our goal is to design an attack strategy that can learn from such natural scenes by leveraging the local patch differences that occur inherently in such images (e.g. difference between the local patch on the object `person' and the object `bike' in a traffic scene). Our key idea is: to misclassify an adversarial multi-object image, each local patch in the image should confuse the victim classifier. Based on this, we propose a novel generative attack (called Local Patch Difference or LPD-Attack) where a novel contrastive loss function uses the aforesaid local differences in feature space of multi-object scenes to optimize the perturbation generator. Through various experiments across diverse victim convolutional neural networks, we show that our approach outperforms baseline generative attacks with highly transferable perturbations when evaluated under different white-box and black-box settings.

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-20    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.09688v1)

**Authors**: Giovanni Trappolini, Valentino Maiorca, Silvio Severino, Emanuele Rodolà, Fabrizio Silvestri, Gabriele Tolomei

**Abstracts**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven to be successful in several predictive modeling tasks for graph-structured data.   Amongst those tasks, link prediction is one of the fundamental problems for many real-world applications, such as recommender systems.   However, GNNs are not immune to adversarial attacks, i.e., carefully crafted malicious examples that are designed to fool the predictive model.   In this work, we focus on a specific, white-box attack to GNN-based link prediction models, where a malicious node aims to appear in the list of recommended nodes for a given target victim.   To achieve this goal, the attacker node may also count on the cooperation of other existing peers that it directly controls, namely on the ability to inject a number of ``vicious'' nodes in the network.   Specifically, all these malicious nodes can add new edges or remove existing ones, thereby perturbing the original graph.   Thus, we propose SAVAGE, a novel framework and a method to mount this type of link prediction attacks.   SAVAGE formulates the adversary's goal as an optimization task, striking the balance between the effectiveness of the attack and the sparsity of malicious resources required.   Extensive experiments conducted on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that adversarial attacks implemented through SAVAGE indeed achieve high attack success rate yet using a small amount of vicious nodes.   Finally, despite those attacks require full knowledge of the target model, we show that they are successfully transferable to other black-box methods for link prediction.



## **3. Understanding Real-world Threats to Deep Learning Models in Android Apps**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-20    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.09577v1)

**Authors**: Zizhuang Deng, Kai Chen, Guozhu Meng, Xiaodong Zhang, Ke Xu, Yao Cheng

**Abstracts**: Famous for its superior performance, deep learning (DL) has been popularly used within many applications, which also at the same time attracts various threats to the models. One primary threat is from adversarial attacks. Researchers have intensively studied this threat for several years and proposed dozens of approaches to create adversarial examples (AEs). But most of the approaches are only evaluated on limited models and datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10). Thus, the effectiveness of attacking real-world DL models is not quite clear. In this paper, we perform the first systematic study of adversarial attacks on real-world DNN models and provide a real-world model dataset named RWM. Particularly, we design a suite of approaches to adapt current AE generation algorithms to the diverse real-world DL models, including automatically extracting DL models from Android apps, capturing the inputs and outputs of the DL models in apps, generating AEs and validating them by observing the apps' execution. For black-box DL models, we design a semantic-based approach to build suitable datasets and use them for training substitute models when performing transfer-based attacks. After analyzing 245 DL models collected from 62,583 real-world apps, we have a unique opportunity to understand the gap between real-world DL models and contemporary AE generation algorithms. To our surprise, the current AE generation algorithms can only directly attack 6.53% of the models. Benefiting from our approach, the success rate upgrades to 47.35%.



## **4. I-GWAS: Privacy-Preserving Interdependent Genome-Wide Association Studies**

q-bio.GN

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-20    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.08361v2)

**Authors**: Túlio Pascoal, Jérémie Decouchant, Antoine Boutet, Marcus Völp

**Abstracts**: Genome-wide Association Studies (GWASes) identify genomic variations that are statistically associated with a trait, such as a disease, in a group of individuals. Unfortunately, careless sharing of GWAS statistics might give rise to privacy attacks. Several works attempted to reconcile secure processing with privacy-preserving releases of GWASes. However, we highlight that these approaches remain vulnerable if GWASes utilize overlapping sets of individuals and genomic variations. In such conditions, we show that even when relying on state-of-the-art techniques for protecting releases, an adversary could reconstruct the genomic variations of up to 28.6% of participants, and that the released statistics of up to 92.3% of the genomic variations would enable membership inference attacks. We introduce I-GWAS, a novel framework that securely computes and releases the results of multiple possibly interdependent GWASes. I-GWAS continuously releases privacy-preserving and noise-free GWAS results as new genomes become available.



## **5. FrequencyLowCut Pooling -- Plug & Play against Catastrophic Overfitting**

cs.CV

accepted at ECCV 2022

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-20    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.00491v2)

**Authors**: Julia Grabinski, Steffen Jung, Janis Keuper, Margret Keuper

**Abstracts**: Over the last years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been the dominating neural architecture in a wide range of computer vision tasks. From an image and signal processing point of view, this success might be a bit surprising as the inherent spatial pyramid design of most CNNs is apparently violating basic signal processing laws, i.e. Sampling Theorem in their down-sampling operations. However, since poor sampling appeared not to affect model accuracy, this issue has been broadly neglected until model robustness started to receive more attention. Recent work [17] in the context of adversarial attacks and distribution shifts, showed after all, that there is a strong correlation between the vulnerability of CNNs and aliasing artifacts induced by poor down-sampling operations. This paper builds on these findings and introduces an aliasing free down-sampling operation which can easily be plugged into any CNN architecture: FrequencyLowCut pooling. Our experiments show, that in combination with simple and fast FGSM adversarial training, our hyper-parameter free operator significantly improves model robustness and avoids catastrophic overfitting.



## **6. GAMA: Generative Adversarial Multi-Object Scene Attacks**

cs.CV

Accepted at NeurIPS 2022; First two authors contributed equally;  Includes Supplementary Material

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-20    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.09502v1)

**Authors**: Abhishek Aich, Calvin Khang-Ta, Akash Gupta, Chengyu Song, Srikanth V. Krishnamurthy, M. Salman Asif, Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury

**Abstracts**: The majority of methods for crafting adversarial attacks have focused on scenes with a single dominant object (e.g., images from ImageNet). On the other hand, natural scenes include multiple dominant objects that are semantically related. Thus, it is crucial to explore designing attack strategies that look beyond learning on single-object scenes or attack single-object victim classifiers. Due to their inherent property of strong transferability of perturbations to unknown models, this paper presents the first approach of using generative models for adversarial attacks on multi-object scenes. In order to represent the relationships between different objects in the input scene, we leverage upon the open-sourced pre-trained vision-language model CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training), with the motivation to exploit the encoded semantics in the language space along with the visual space. We call this attack approach Generative Adversarial Multi-object scene Attacks (GAMA). GAMA demonstrates the utility of the CLIP model as an attacker's tool to train formidable perturbation generators for multi-object scenes. Using the joint image-text features to train the generator, we show that GAMA can craft potent transferable perturbations in order to fool victim classifiers in various attack settings. For example, GAMA triggers ~16% more misclassification than state-of-the-art generative approaches in black-box settings where both the classifier architecture and data distribution of the attacker are different from the victim. Our code will be made publicly available soon.



## **7. Learn2Weight: Parameter Adaptation against Similar-domain Adversarial Attacks**

cs.LG

Accepted in COLING 2022

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-20    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.07315v2)

**Authors**: Siddhartha Datta

**Abstracts**: Recent work in black-box adversarial attacks for NLP systems has attracted much attention. Prior black-box attacks assume that attackers can observe output labels from target models based on selected inputs. In this work, inspired by adversarial transferability, we propose a new type of black-box NLP adversarial attack that an attacker can choose a similar domain and transfer the adversarial examples to the target domain and cause poor performance in target model. Based on domain adaptation theory, we then propose a defensive strategy, called Learn2Weight, which trains to predict the weight adjustments for a target model in order to defend against an attack of similar-domain adversarial examples. Using Amazon multi-domain sentiment classification datasets, we empirically show that Learn2Weight is effective against the attack compared to standard black-box defense methods such as adversarial training and defensive distillation. This work contributes to the growing literature on machine learning safety.



## **8. Security and Privacy of Wireless Beacon Systems**

cs.CR

13 pages, 3 figures

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-20    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.05868v2)

**Authors**: Aldar C-F. Chan, Raymond M. H. Chung

**Abstracts**: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons have been increasingly used in smart city applications, such as location-based and proximity-based services, to enable Internet of Things to interact with people in vicinity or enhance context-awareness. Their widespread deployment in human-centric applications makes them an attractive target to adversaries for social or economic reasons. In fact, beacons are reportedly exposed to various security issues and privacy concerns. A characterization of attacks against beacon systems is given to help understand adversary motives, required adversarial capabilities, potential impact and possible defence mechanisms for different threats, with a view to facilitating security evaluation and protection formulation for beacon systems.



## **9. Parallel Proof-of-Work with Concrete Bounds**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-19    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.00034v2)

**Authors**: Patrik Keller, Rainer Böhme

**Abstracts**: Authorization is challenging in distributed systems that cannot rely on the identification of nodes. Proof-of-work offers an alternative gate-keeping mechanism, but its probabilistic nature is incompatible with conventional security definitions. Recent related work establishes concrete bounds for the failure probability of Bitcoin's sequential proof-of-work mechanism. We propose a family of state replication protocols using parallel proof-of-work. Our bottom-up design from an agreement sub-protocol allows us to give concrete bounds for the failure probability in adversarial synchronous networks. After the typical interval of 10 minutes, parallel proof-of-work offers two orders of magnitude more security than sequential proof-of-work. This means that state updates can be sufficiently secure to support commits after one block (i.e., after 10 minutes), removing the risk of double-spending in many applications. We offer guidance on the optimal choice of parameters for a wide range of network and attacker assumptions. Simulations show that the proposed construction is robust against violations of design assumptions.



## **10. A Transferable and Automatic Tuning of Deep Reinforcement Learning for Cost Effective Phishing Detection**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-19    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.09033v1)

**Authors**: Orel Lavie, Asaf Shabtai, Gilad Katz

**Abstracts**: Many challenging real-world problems require the deployment of ensembles multiple complementary learning models to reach acceptable performance levels. While effective, applying the entire ensemble to every sample is costly and often unnecessary. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a cost-effective alternative, where detectors are dynamically chosen based on the output of their predecessors, with their usefulness weighted against their computational cost. Despite their potential, DRL-based solutions are not widely used in this capacity, partly due to the difficulties in configuring the reward function for each new task, the unpredictable reactions of the DRL agent to changes in the data, and the inability to use common performance metrics (e.g., TPR/FPR) to guide the algorithm's performance. In this study we propose methods for fine-tuning and calibrating DRL-based policies so that they can meet multiple performance goals. Moreover, we present a method for transferring effective security policies from one dataset to another. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach is highly robust against adversarial attacks.



## **11. Encrypted Semantic Communication Using Adversarial Training for Privacy Preserving**

cs.IT

submitted to IEEE Wireless Communications Letters

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-19    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.09008v1)

**Authors**: Xinlai Luo, Zhiyong Chen, Meixia Tao, Feng Yang

**Abstracts**: Semantic communication is implemented based on shared background knowledge, but the sharing mechanism risks privacy leakage. In this letter, we propose an encrypted semantic communication system (ESCS) for privacy preserving, which combines universality and confidentiality. The universality is reflected in that all network modules of the proposed ESCS are trained based on a shared database, which is suitable for large-scale deployment in practical scenarios. Meanwhile, the confidentiality is achieved by symmetric encryption. Based on the adversarial training, we design an adversarial encryption training scheme to guarantee the accuracy of semantic communication in both encrypted and unencrypted modes. Experiment results show that the proposed ESCS with the adversarial encryption training scheme can perform well regardless of whether the semantic information is encrypted. It is difficult for the attacker to reconstruct the original semantic information from the eavesdropped message.



## **12. Adversarial Color Projection: A Projector-Based Physical Attack to DNNs**

cs.CR

arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2209.02430

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-19    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.09652v1)

**Authors**: Chengyin Hu, Weiwen Shi

**Abstracts**: Recent advances have shown that deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to adversarial perturbations. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the robustness of advanced DNNs using adversarial attacks. However, traditional physical attacks that use stickers as perturbations are more vulnerable than recent light-based physical attacks. In this work, we propose a projector-based physical attack called adversarial color projection (AdvCP), which performs an adversarial attack by manipulating the physical parameters of the projected light. Experiments show the effectiveness of our method in both digital and physical environments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has excellent attack transferability, which endows AdvCP with effective blackbox attack. We prospect AdvCP threats to future vision-based systems and applications and propose some ideas for light-based physical attacks.



## **13. A Systematic Evaluation of Node Embedding Robustness**

cs.LG

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-19    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.08064v2)

**Authors**: Alexandru Mara, Jefrey Lijffijt, Stephan Günnemann, Tijl De Bie

**Abstracts**: Node embedding methods map network nodes to low dimensional vectors that can be subsequently used in a variety of downstream prediction tasks. The popularity of these methods has significantly increased in recent years, yet, their robustness to perturbations of the input data is still poorly understood. In this paper, we assess the empirical robustness of node embedding models to random and adversarial poisoning attacks. Our systematic evaluation covers representative embedding methods based on Skip-Gram, matrix factorization, and deep neural networks. We compare edge addition, deletion and rewiring strategies computed using network properties as well as node labels. We also investigate the effect of label homophily and heterophily on robustness. We report qualitative results via embedding visualization and quantitative results in terms of downstream node classification and network reconstruction performances. We found that node classification suffers from higher performance degradation as opposed to network reconstruction, and that degree-based and label-based attacks are on average the most damaging.



## **14. Indicators of Attack Failure: Debugging and Improving Optimization of Adversarial Examples**

cs.LG

Accepted at NeurIPS 2022

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-19    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09947v2)

**Authors**: Maura Pintor, Luca Demetrio, Angelo Sotgiu, Ambra Demontis, Nicholas Carlini, Battista Biggio, Fabio Roli

**Abstracts**: Evaluating robustness of machine-learning models to adversarial examples is a challenging problem. Many defenses have been shown to provide a false sense of robustness by causing gradient-based attacks to fail, and they have been broken under more rigorous evaluations. Although guidelines and best practices have been suggested to improve current adversarial robustness evaluations, the lack of automatic testing and debugging tools makes it difficult to apply these recommendations in a systematic manner. In this work, we overcome these limitations by: (i) categorizing attack failures based on how they affect the optimization of gradient-based attacks, while also unveiling two novel failures affecting many popular attack implementations and past evaluations; (ii) proposing six novel indicators of failure, to automatically detect the presence of such failures in the attack optimization process; and (iii) suggesting a systematic protocol to apply the corresponding fixes. Our extensive experimental analysis, involving more than 15 models in 3 distinct application domains, shows that our indicators of failure can be used to debug and improve current adversarial robustness evaluations, thereby providing a first concrete step towards automatizing and systematizing them. Our open-source code is available at: https://github.com/pralab/IndicatorsOfAttackFailure.



## **15. Evaluating Machine Unlearning via Epistemic Uncertainty**

cs.LG

Rejected at ECML 2021. Even though the paper was rejected, we want to  "publish" it on arxiv, since we believe that it is nevertheless interesting  to investigate the connections between unlearning and uncertainty v2: Added  acknowledgment and code repository

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-19    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.10836v2)

**Authors**: Alexander Becker, Thomas Liebig

**Abstracts**: There has been a growing interest in Machine Unlearning recently, primarily due to legal requirements such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act. Thus, multiple approaches were presented to remove the influence of specific target data points from a trained model. However, when evaluating the success of unlearning, current approaches either use adversarial attacks or compare their results to the optimal solution, which usually incorporates retraining from scratch. We argue that both ways are insufficient in practice. In this work, we present an evaluation metric for Machine Unlearning algorithms based on epistemic uncertainty. This is the first definition of a general evaluation metric for Machine Unlearning to our best knowledge.



## **16. AdvDO: Realistic Adversarial Attacks for Trajectory Prediction**

cs.LG

To appear in ECCV 2022

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-19    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.08744v1)

**Authors**: Yulong Cao, Chaowei Xiao, Anima Anandkumar, Danfei Xu, Marco Pavone

**Abstracts**: Trajectory prediction is essential for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to plan correct and safe driving behaviors. While many prior works aim to achieve higher prediction accuracy, few study the adversarial robustness of their methods. To bridge this gap, we propose to study the adversarial robustness of data-driven trajectory prediction systems. We devise an optimization-based adversarial attack framework that leverages a carefully-designed differentiable dynamic model to generate realistic adversarial trajectories. Empirically, we benchmark the adversarial robustness of state-of-the-art prediction models and show that our attack increases the prediction error for both general metrics and planning-aware metrics by more than 50% and 37%. We also show that our attack can lead an AV to drive off road or collide into other vehicles in simulation. Finally, we demonstrate how to mitigate the adversarial attacks using an adversarial training scheme.



## **17. On the Adversarial Transferability of ConvMixer Models**

cs.LG

5 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables. arXiv admin note: substantial text  overlap with arXiv:2209.02997

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-19    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.08724v1)

**Authors**: Ryota Iijima, Miki Tanaka, Isao Echizen, Hitoshi Kiya

**Abstracts**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are well known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs). In addition, AEs have adversarial transferability, which means AEs generated for a source model can fool another black-box model (target model) with a non-trivial probability. In this paper, we investigate the property of adversarial transferability between models including ConvMixer, which is an isotropic network, for the first time. To objectively verify the property of transferability, the robustness of models is evaluated by using a benchmark attack method called AutoAttack. In an image classification experiment, ConvMixer is confirmed to be weak to adversarial transferability.



## **18. Reinforcement learning-based optimised control for tracking of nonlinear systems with adversarial attacks**

eess.SY

Submitted for The 10th RSI International Conference on Robotics and  Mechatronics (ICRoM 2022)

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-18    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.02165v2)

**Authors**: Farshad Rahimi, Sepideh Ziaei

**Abstracts**: This paper introduces a reinforcement learning-based tracking control approach for a class of nonlinear systems using neural networks. In this approach, adversarial attacks were considered both in the actuator and on the outputs. This approach incorporates a simultaneous tracking and optimization process. It is necessary to be able to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation (HJB) in order to obtain optimal control input, but this is difficult due to the strong nonlinearity terms in the equation. In order to find the solution to the HJB equation, we used a reinforcement learning approach. In this online adaptive learning approach, three neural networks are simultaneously adapted: the critic neural network, the actor neural network, and the adversary neural network. Ultimately, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the introduced method on a manipulator.



## **19. Distribution inference risks: Identifying and mitigating sources of leakage**

cs.CR

14 pages, 8 figures

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-18    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.08541v1)

**Authors**: Valentin Hartmann, Léo Meynent, Maxime Peyrard, Dimitrios Dimitriadis, Shruti Tople, Robert West

**Abstracts**: A large body of work shows that machine learning (ML) models can leak sensitive or confidential information about their training data. Recently, leakage due to distribution inference (or property inference) attacks is gaining attention. In this attack, the goal of an adversary is to infer distributional information about the training data. So far, research on distribution inference has focused on demonstrating successful attacks, with little attention given to identifying the potential causes of the leakage and to proposing mitigations. To bridge this gap, as our main contribution, we theoretically and empirically analyze the sources of information leakage that allows an adversary to perpetrate distribution inference attacks. We identify three sources of leakage: (1) memorizing specific information about the $\mathbb{E}[Y|X]$ (expected label given the feature values) of interest to the adversary, (2) wrong inductive bias of the model, and (3) finiteness of the training data. Next, based on our analysis, we propose principled mitigation techniques against distribution inference attacks. Specifically, we demonstrate that causal learning techniques are more resilient to a particular type of distribution inference risk termed distributional membership inference than associative learning methods. And lastly, we present a formalization of distribution inference that allows for reasoning about more general adversaries than was previously possible.



## **20. pFedDef: Defending Grey-Box Attacks for Personalized Federated Learning**

cs.LG

16 pages, 5 figures (11 images if counting sub-figures separately),  longer version of paper submitted to CrossFL 2022 poster workshop, code  available at (https://github.com/tj-kim/pFedDef_v1)

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-17    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.08412v1)

**Authors**: Taejin Kim, Shubhranshu Singh, Nikhil Madaan, Carlee Joe-Wong

**Abstracts**: Personalized federated learning allows for clients in a distributed system to train a neural network tailored to their unique local data while leveraging information at other clients. However, clients' models are vulnerable to attacks during both the training and testing phases. In this paper we address the issue of adversarial clients crafting evasion attacks at test time to deceive other clients. For example, adversaries may aim to deceive spam filters and recommendation systems trained with personalized federated learning for monetary gain. The adversarial clients have varying degrees of personalization based on the method of distributed learning, leading to a "grey-box" situation. We are the first to characterize the transferability of such internal evasion attacks for different learning methods and analyze the trade-off between model accuracy and robustness depending on the degree of personalization and similarities in client data. We introduce a defense mechanism, pFedDef, that performs personalized federated adversarial training while respecting resource limitations at clients that inhibit adversarial training. Overall, pFedDef increases relative grey-box adversarial robustness by 62% compared to federated adversarial training and performs well even under limited system resources.



## **21. Decentralization Paradox: A Study of Hegemonic and Risky ERC-20 Tokens**

cs.CR

2022 Engineering Graduate Research Symposium (EGRS)

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-17    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.08370v1)

**Authors**: Nikolay Ivanov, Qiben Yan

**Abstracts**: In this work, we explore the class of Ethereum smart contracts called the administrated ERC20 tokens. We demonstrate that these contracts are more owner-controlled and less safe than the services they try to disrupt, such as banks and centralized online payment systems. We develop a binary classifier for identification of administrated ERC20 tokens, and conduct extensive data analysis, which reveals that nearly 9 out of 10 ERC20 tokens on Ethereum are administrated, and thereby unsafe to engage with even under the assumption of trust towards their owners. We design and implement SafelyAdministrated - a Solidity abstract class that safeguards users of administrated ERC20 tokens from adversarial attacks or frivolous behavior of the tokens' owners.



## **22. Robust Online and Distributed Mean Estimation Under Adversarial Data Corruption**

cs.CR

8 pages, 5 figures, 61st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control  (CDC)

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-17    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.09624v1)

**Authors**: Tong Yao, Shreyas Sundaram

**Abstracts**: We study robust mean estimation in an online and distributed scenario in the presence of adversarial data attacks. At each time step, each agent in a network receives a potentially corrupted data point, where the data points were originally independent and identically distributed samples of a random variable. We propose online and distributed algorithms for all agents to asymptotically estimate the mean. We provide the error-bound and the convergence properties of the estimates to the true mean under our algorithms. Based on the network topology, we further evaluate each agent's trade-off in convergence rate between incorporating data from neighbors and learning with only local observations.



## **23. Replay-based Recovery for Autonomous Robotic Vehicles from Sensor Deception Attacks**

cs.RO

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-17    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.04554v3)

**Authors**: Pritam Dash, Guanpeng Li, Mehdi Karimibiuki, Karthik Pattabiraman

**Abstracts**: Sensors are crucial for autonomous operation in robotic vehicles (RV). Physical attacks on sensors such as sensor tampering or spoofing can feed erroneous values to RVs through physical channels, which results in mission failures. In this paper, we present DeLorean, a comprehensive diagnosis and recovery framework for securing autonomous RVs from physical attacks. We consider a strong form of physical attack called sensor deception attacks (SDAs), in which the adversary targets multiple sensors of different types simultaneously (even including all sensors). Under SDAs, DeLorean inspects the attack induced errors, identifies the targeted sensors, and prevents the erroneous sensor inputs from being used in RV's feedback control loop. DeLorean replays historic state information in the feedback control loop and recovers the RV from attacks. Our evaluation on four real and two simulated RVs shows that DeLorean can recover RVs from different attacks, and ensure mission success in 94% of the cases (on average), without any crashes. DeLorean incurs low performance, memory and battery overheads.



## **24. Resilient Risk based Adaptive Authentication and Authorization (RAD-AA) Framework**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-17    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.02592v2)

**Authors**: Jaimandeep Singh, Chintan Patel, Naveen Kumar Chaudhary

**Abstracts**: In recent cyber attacks, credential theft has emerged as one of the primary vectors of gaining entry into the system. Once attacker(s) have a foothold in the system, they use various techniques including token manipulation to elevate the privileges and access protected resources. This makes authentication and token based authorization a critical component for a secure and resilient cyber system. In this paper we discuss the design considerations for such a secure and resilient authentication and authorization framework capable of self-adapting based on the risk scores and trust profiles. We compare this design with the existing standards such as OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect and SAML 2.0. We then study popular threat models such as STRIDE and PASTA and summarize the resilience of the proposed architecture against common and relevant threat vectors. We call this framework as Resilient Risk based Adaptive Authentication and Authorization (RAD-AA). The proposed framework excessively increases the cost for an adversary to launch and sustain any cyber attack and provides much-needed strength to critical infrastructure. We also discuss the machine learning (ML) approach for the adaptive engine to accurately classify transactions and arrive at risk scores.



## **25. Robust Prototypical Few-Shot Organ Segmentation with Regularized Neural-ODEs**

cs.CV

**SubmitDate**: 2022-09-17    [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.12428v2)

**Authors**: Prashant Pandey, Mustafa Chasmai, Tanuj Sur, Brejesh Lall

**Abstracts**: Despite the tremendous progress made by deep learning models in image semantic segmentation, they typically require large annotated examples, and increasing attention is being diverted to problem settings like Few-Shot Learning (FSL) where only a small amount of annotation is needed for generalisation to novel classes. This is especially seen in medical domains where dense pixel-level annotations are expensive to obtain. In this paper, we propose Regularized Prototypical Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (R-PNODE), a method that leverages intrinsic properties of Neural-ODEs, assisted and enhanced by additional cluster and consistency losses to perform Few-Shot Segmentation (FSS) of organs. R-PNODE constrains support and query features from the same classes to lie closer in the representation space thereby improving the performance over the existing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based FSS methods. We further demonstrate that while many existing Deep CNN based methods tend to be extremely vulnerable to adversarial attacks, R-PNODE exhibits increased adversarial robustness for a wide array of these attacks. We experiment with three publicly available multi-organ segmentation datasets in both in-domain and cross-domain FSS settings to demonstrate the efficacy of our method. In addition, we perform experiments with seven commonly used adversarial attacks in various settings to demonstrate R-PNODE's robustness. R-PNODE outperforms the baselines for FSS by significant margins and also shows superior performance for a wide array of attacks varying in intensity and design.

**Abstracts**: Various cryptographic techniques are used in outsourced database systems to ensure data privacy while allowing for efficient querying. This work proposes a definition and components of a new secure and efficient outsourced database system, which answers various types of queries, with different privacy guarantees in different security models. This work starts with the survey of five order-revealing encryption schemes that can be used directly in many database indices and five range query protocols with various security / efficiency tradeoffs. The survey systematizes the state-of-the-art range query solutions in a snapshot adversary setting and offers some non-obvious observations regarding the efficiency of the constructions. In $\mathcal{E}\text{psolute}$, a secure range query engine, security is achieved in a setting with a much stronger adversary where she can continuously observe everything on the server, and leaking even the result size can enable a reconstruction attack. $\mathcal{E}\text{psolute}$ proposes a definition, construction, analysis, and experimental evaluation of a system that provably hides both access pattern and communication volume while remaining efficient. The work concludes with $k\text{-a}n\text{o}n$ -- a secure similarity search engine in a snapshot adversary model. The work presents a construction in which the security of $k\text{NN}$ queries is achieved similarly to OPE / ORE solutions -- encrypting the input with an approximate Distance Comparison Preserving Encryption scheme so that the inputs, the points in a hyperspace, are perturbed, but the query algorithm still produces accurate results. We use TREC datasets and queries for the search, and track the rank quality metrics such as MRR and nDCG. For the attacks, we build an LSTM model that trains on the correlation between a sentence and its embedding and then predicts words from the embedding.

**Abstracts**: Although a substantial amount of studies is dedicated to morph detection, most of them fail to generalize for morph faces outside of their training paradigm. Moreover, recent morph detection methods are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we intend to learn a morph detection model with high generalization to a wide range of morphing attacks and high robustness against different adversarial attacks. To this aim, we develop an ensemble of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer models to benefit from their capabilities simultaneously. To improve the robust accuracy of the ensemble model, we employ multi-perturbation adversarial training and generate adversarial examples with high transferability for several single models. Our exhaustive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed robust ensemble model generalizes to several morphing attacks and face datasets. In addition, we validate that our robust ensemble model gain better robustness against several adversarial attacks while outperforming the state-of-the-art studies.

**Abstracts**: Deep learning is a standard tool in the field of high-energy physics, facilitating considerable sensitivity enhancements for numerous analysis strategies. In particular, in identification of physics objects, such as jet flavor tagging, complex neural network architectures play a major role. However, these methods are reliant on accurate simulations. Mismodeling can lead to non-negligible differences in performance in data that need to be measured and calibrated against. We investigate the classifier response to input data with injected mismodelings and probe the vulnerability of flavor tagging algorithms via application of adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we present an adversarial training strategy that mitigates the impact of such simulated attacks and improves the classifier robustness. We examine the relationship between performance and vulnerability and show that this method constitutes a promising approach to reduce the vulnerability to poor modeling.

**Abstracts**: This paper studies the consequences of a human-initiated targeted attack on the national electric power system. We consider two kinds of attacks: ($i$) an attack by an adversary that uses a tactical weapon and destroys a large part of the grid, by physically targeting a large geographic region; ($ii$) a targeted attack by an adversary that takes out a small number of critical components in the network simultaneously. Our analysis uses ($i$) a realistic representation of the underlying power grid, including the topology, the control and protection components, ($ii$) a realistic representation of the targeted attack scenario, and ($iii$) a dynamic stability analysis, that goes beyond traditional work comprising structural and linear flow analysis. Such realistic analysis is expensive, but critical since it can capture cascading failures that result from transient instabilities introduced due to the attack. Our model acknowledges the presence of hidden failures in the protection systems resulting in relay misoperations. We analyze the extent of cascading outages for different levels of hidden failures. Our results show that: ($i$) the power grid is vulnerable to both these attacks, ($ii$) the tactical attack has significant social, economic and health damage but need not result in a regional cascade; on the contrary the targeted attack can cause significant cascade and lead to power outage over a large region. Our work shows the necessity to harden the power grid not just to cyber-attacks but also to physical attacks. Furthermore, we show that realistic representations and analysis can lead to fundamentally new insights that simplified models are unlikely to capture. Finally, the methods and results help us identify critical elements in the grid; the system can then be hardened in a more precise manner to reduce the vulnerabilities.

**Abstracts**: As research in deep neural networks has advanced, deep convolutional networks have become feasible for automated driving tasks. In particular, there is an emerging trend of employing end-to-end neural network models for the automation of driving tasks. However, previous research has shown that deep neural network classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. For regression tasks, however, the effect of adversarial attacks is not as well understood. In this paper, we devise two white-box targeted attacks against end-to-end autonomous driving systems. The driving systems use a regression model that takes an image as input and outputs a steering angle. Our attacks manipulate the behavior of the autonomous driving system by perturbing the input image. Both attacks can be initiated in real-time on CPUs without employing GPUs. The efficiency of the attacks is illustrated using experiments conducted in Udacity. Demo video: https://youtu.be/I0i8uN2oOP0.

**Abstracts**: Hardware supply-chain attacks are raising significant security threats to the boot process of multiprocessor systems. This paper identifies a new, prevalent hardware supply-chain attack surface that can bypass multiprocessor secure boot due to the absence of processor-authentication mechanisms. To defend against such attacks, we present PA-Boot, the first formally verified processor-authentication protocol for secure boot in multiprocessor systems. PA-Boot is proved functionally correct and is guaranteed to detect multiple adversarial behaviors, e.g., processor replacements, man-in-the-middle attacks, and tampering with certificates. The fine-grained formalization of PA-Boot and its fully mechanized security proofs are carried out in the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover with 306 lemmas/theorems and ~7,100 LoC. Experiments on a proof-of-concept implementation indicate that PA-Boot can effectively identify boot-process attacks with a considerably minor overhead and thereby improve the security of multiprocessor systems.

**Abstracts**: Distributed deep learning frameworks such as split learning provide great benefits with regards to the computational cost of training deep neural networks and the privacy-aware utilization of the collective data of a group of data-holders. Split learning, in particular, achieves this goal by dividing a neural network between a client and a server so that the client computes the initial set of layers, and the server computes the rest. However, this method introduces a unique attack vector for a malicious server attempting to steal the client's private data: the server can direct the client model towards learning any task of its choice, e.g. towards outputting easily invertible values. With a concrete example already proposed (Pasquini et al., CCS '21), such training-hijacking attacks present a significant risk for the data privacy of split learning clients.   In this paper, we propose SplitGuard, a method by which a split learning client can detect whether it is being targeted by a training-hijacking attack or not. We experimentally evaluate our method's effectiveness, compare it with potential alternatives, and discuss in detail various points related to its use. We conclude that SplitGuard can effectively detect training-hijacking attacks while minimizing the amount of information recovered by the adversaries.

**Authors**: Qiongxiu Li, Jaron Skovsted Gundersen, Katrine Tjell, Rafal Wisniewski, Mads Græsbøll Christensen

**Abstracts**: Privacy has become a major concern in machine learning. In fact, the federated learning is motivated by the privacy concern as it does not allow to transmit the private data but only intermediate updates. However, federated learning does not always guarantee privacy-preservation as the intermediate updates may also reveal sensitive information. In this paper, we give an explicit information-theoretical analysis of a federated expectation maximization algorithm for Gaussian mixture model and prove that the intermediate updates can cause severe privacy leakage. To address the privacy issue, we propose a fully decentralized privacy-preserving solution, which is able to securely compute the updates in each maximization step. Additionally, we consider two different types of security attacks: the honest-but-curious and eavesdropping adversary models. Numerical validation shows that the proposed approach has superior performance compared to the existing approach in terms of both the accuracy and privacy level.

**Authors**: Siyuan Liang, Longkang Li, Yanbo Fan, Xiaojun Jia, Jingzhi Li, Baoyuan Wu, Xiaochun Cao

**Abstracts**: Recent studies have shown that detectors based on deep models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, even in the black-box scenario where the attacker cannot access the model information. Most existing attack methods aim to minimize the true positive rate, which often shows poor attack performance, as another sub-optimal bounding box may be detected around the attacked bounding box to be the new true positive one. To settle this challenge, we propose to minimize the true positive rate and maximize the false positive rate, which can encourage more false positive objects to block the generation of new true positive bounding boxes. It is modeled as a multi-objective optimization (MOP) problem, of which the generic algorithm can search the Pareto-optimal. However, our task has more than two million decision variables, leading to low searching efficiency. Thus, we extend the standard Genetic Algorithm with Random Subset selection and Divide-and-Conquer, called GARSDC, which significantly improves the efficiency. Moreover, to alleviate the sensitivity to population quality in generic algorithms, we generate a gradient-prior initial population, utilizing the transferability between different detectors with similar backbones. Compared with the state-of-art attack methods, GARSDC decreases by an average 12.0 in the mAP and queries by about 1000 times in extensive experiments.

**Authors**: Qidong Huang, Xiaoyi Dong, Dongdong Chen, Hang Zhou, Weiming Zhang, Kui Zhang, Gang Hua, Nenghai Yu

**Abstracts**: Notwithstanding the prominent performance achieved in various applications, point cloud recognition models have often suffered from natural corruptions and adversarial perturbations. In this paper, we delve into boosting the general robustness of point cloud recognition models and propose Point-Cloud Contrastive Adversarial Training (PointCAT). The main intuition of PointCAT is encouraging the target recognition model to narrow the decision gap between clean point clouds and corrupted point clouds. Specifically, we leverage a supervised contrastive loss to facilitate the alignment and uniformity of the hypersphere features extracted by the recognition model, and design a pair of centralizing losses with the dynamic prototype guidance to avoid these features deviating from their belonging category clusters. To provide the more challenging corrupted point clouds, we adversarially train a noise generator along with the recognition model from the scratch, instead of using gradient-based attack as the inner loop like previous adversarial training methods. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed PointCAT outperforms the baseline methods and dramatically boosts the robustness of different point cloud recognition models, under a variety of corruptions including isotropic point noises, the LiDAR simulated noises, random point dropping and adversarial perturbations.

**Authors**: Yang Song, Qiyu Kang, Sijie Wang, Zhao Kai, Wee Peng Tay

**Abstracts**: Neural diffusion on graphs is a novel class of graph neural networks that has attracted increasing attention recently. The capability of graph neural partial differential equations (PDEs) in addressing common hurdles of graph neural networks (GNNs), such as the problems of over-smoothing and bottlenecks, has been investigated but not their robustness to adversarial attacks. In this work, we explore the robustness properties of graph neural PDEs. We empirically demonstrate that graph neural PDEs are intrinsically more robust against topology perturbation as compared to other GNNs. We provide insights into this phenomenon by exploiting the stability of the heat semigroup under graph topology perturbations. We discuss various graph diffusion operators and relate them to existing graph neural PDEs. Furthermore, we propose a general graph neural PDE framework based on which a new class of robust GNNs can be defined. We verify that the new model achieves comparable state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.

**Authors**: Erik Rye, Robert Beverly

**Abstracts**: We present IPvSeeYou, a privacy attack that permits a remote and unprivileged adversary to physically geolocate many residential IPv6 hosts and networks with street-level precision. The crux of our method involves: 1) remotely discovering wide area (WAN) hardware MAC addresses from home routers; 2) correlating these MAC addresses with their WiFi BSSID counterparts of known location; and 3) extending coverage by associating devices connected to a common penultimate provider router.   We first obtain a large corpus of MACs embedded in IPv6 addresses via high-speed network probing. These MAC addresses are effectively leaked up the protocol stack and largely represent WAN interfaces of residential routers, many of which are all-in-one devices that also provide WiFi. We develop a technique to statistically infer the mapping between a router's WAN and WiFi MAC addresses across manufacturers and devices, and mount a large-scale data fusion attack that correlates WAN MACs with WiFi BSSIDs available in wardriving (geolocation) databases. Using these correlations, we geolocate the IPv6 prefixes of $>$12M routers in the wild across 146 countries and territories. Selected validation confirms a median geolocation error of 39 meters. We then exploit technology and deployment constraints to extend the attack to a larger set of IPv6 residential routers by clustering and associating devices with a common penultimate provider router. While we responsibly disclosed our results to several manufacturers and providers, the ossified ecosystem of deployed residential cable and DSL routers suggests that our attack will remain a privacy threat into the foreseeable future.

**Abstracts**: Intelligent robots rely on object detection models to perceive the environment. Following advances in deep learning security it has been revealed that object detection models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, prior research primarily focuses on attacking static images or offline videos. Therefore, it is still unclear if such attacks could jeopardize real-world robotic applications in dynamic environments. This paper bridges this gap by presenting the first real-time online attack against object detection models. We devise three attacks that fabricate bounding boxes for nonexistent objects at desired locations. The attacks achieve a success rate of about 90% within about 20 iterations.

**Abstracts**: Thanks to the increasing power of CPUs and GPUs in embedded systems, deep-learning-enabled object detection systems have become pervasive in a multitude of robotic applications. While deep learning models are vulnerable to several well-known adversarial attacks, the applicability of these attacks is severely limited by strict assumptions on, for example, access to the detection system. Inspired by Man-in-the-Middle attacks in cryptography, we propose a novel hardware attack on object detection systems that overcomes these limitations. Experiments prove that it is possible to generate an efficient Universal Adversarial Perturbation (UAP) within one minute and then use the perturbation to attack a detection system via the Man-in-the-Middle attack. These findings raise serious concerns for applications of deep learning models in safety-critical systems, such as autonomous driving. Demo Video: https://youtu.be/OvIpe-R3ZS8.

**Abstracts**: In the future, powerful AI systems may be deployed in high-stakes settings, where a single failure could be catastrophic. One technique for improving AI safety in high-stakes settings is adversarial training, which uses an adversary to generate examples to train on in order to achieve better worst-case performance.   In this work, we used a language generation task as a testbed for achieving high reliability through adversarial training. We created a series of adversarial training techniques -- including a tool that assists human adversaries -- to find and eliminate failures in a classifier that filters text completions suggested by a generator. In our simple "avoid injuries" task, we determined that we can set very conservative classifier thresholds without significantly impacting the quality of the filtered outputs. With our chosen thresholds, filtering with our baseline classifier decreases the rate of unsafe completions from about 2.4% to 0.003% on in-distribution data, which is near the limit of our ability to measure. We found that adversarial training significantly increased robustness to the adversarial attacks that we trained on, without affecting in-distribution performance. We hope to see further work in the high-stakes reliability setting, including more powerful tools for enhancing human adversaries and better ways to measure high levels of reliability, until we can confidently rule out the possibility of catastrophic deployment-time failures of powerful models.

**Authors**: Yi Shi, Yalin E. Sagduyu, Tugba Erpek, M. Cenk Gursoy

**Abstracts**: In this paper, reinforcement learning (RL) for network slicing is considered in NextG radio access networks, where the base station (gNodeB) allocates resource blocks (RBs) to the requests of user equipments and aims to maximize the total reward of accepted requests over time. Based on adversarial machine learning, a novel over-the-air attack is introduced to manipulate the RL algorithm and disrupt NextG network slicing. The adversary observes the spectrum and builds its own RL based surrogate model that selects which RBs to jam subject to an energy budget with the objective of maximizing the number of failed requests due to jammed RBs. By jamming the RBs, the adversary reduces the RL algorithm's reward. As this reward is used as the input to update the RL algorithm, the performance does not recover even after the adversary stops jamming. This attack is evaluated in terms of both the recovery time and the (maximum and total) reward loss, and it is shown to be much more effective than benchmark (random and myopic) jamming attacks. Different reactive and proactive defense schemes (protecting the RL algorithm's updates or misleading the adversary's learning process) are introduced to show that it is viable to defend NextG network slicing against this attack.

**Authors**: Edoardo Debenedetti, Vikash Sehwag, Prateek Mittal

**Abstracts**: In this paper, we ask whether Vision Transformers (ViTs) can serve as an underlying architecture for improving the adversarial robustness of machine learning models against evasion attacks. While earlier works have focused on improving Convolutional Neural Networks, we show that also ViTs are highly suitable for adversarial training to achieve competitive performance. We achieve this objective using a custom adversarial training recipe, discovered using rigorous ablation studies on a subset of the ImageNet dataset. The canonical training recipe for ViTs recommends strong data augmentation, in part to compensate for the lack of vision inductive bias of attention modules, when compared to convolutions. We show that this recipe achieves suboptimal performance when used for adversarial training. In contrast, we find that omitting all heavy data augmentation, and adding some additional bag-of-tricks ($\varepsilon$-warmup and larger weight decay), significantly boosts the performance of robust ViTs. We show that our recipe generalizes to different classes of ViT architectures and large-scale models on full ImageNet-1k. Additionally, investigating the reasons for the robustness of our models, we show that it is easier to generate strong attacks during training when using our recipe and that this leads to better robustness at test time. Finally, we further study one consequence of adversarial training by proposing a way to quantify the semantic nature of adversarial perturbations and highlight its correlation with the robustness of the model. Overall, we recommend that the community should avoid translating the canonical training recipes in ViTs to robust training and rethink common training choices in the context of adversarial training.

**Authors**: Steve Alpern, Thuy Bui, Thomas Lidbetter, Katerina Papadaki

**Abstracts**: We study a patrolling game played on a network $Q$, considered as a metric space. The Attacker chooses a point of $Q$ (not necessarily a node) to attack during a chosen time interval of fixed duration. The Patroller chooses a unit speed path on $Q$ and intercepts the attack (and wins) if she visits the attacked point during the attack time interval. This zero-sum game models the problem of protecting roads or pipelines from an adversarial attack. The payoff to the maximizing Patroller is the probability that the attack is intercepted. Our results include the following: (i) a solution to the game for any network $Q$, as long as the time required to carry out the attack is sufficiently short, (ii) a solution to the game for all tree networks that satisfy a certain condition on their extremities, and (iii) a solution to the game for any attack duration for stars with one long arc and the remaining arcs equal in length. We present a conjecture on the solution of the game for arbitrary trees and establish it in certain cases.

**Authors**: Giulio Rossolini, Federico Nesti, Fabio Brau, Alessandro Biondi, Giorgio Buttazzo

**Abstracts**: This work presents Z-Mask, a robust and effective strategy to improve the adversarial robustness of convolutional networks against physically-realizable adversarial attacks. The presented defense relies on specific Z-score analysis performed on the internal network features to detect and mask the pixels corresponding to adversarial objects in the input image. To this end, spatially contiguous activations are examined in shallow and deep layers to suggest potential adversarial regions. Such proposals are then aggregated through a multi-thresholding mechanism. The effectiveness of Z-Mask is evaluated with an extensive set of experiments carried out on models for both semantic segmentation and object detection. The evaluation is performed with both digital patches added to the input images and printed patches positioned in the real world. The obtained results confirm that Z-Mask outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both detection accuracy and overall performance of the networks under attack. Additional experiments showed that Z-Mask is also robust against possible defense-aware attacks.

**Authors**: Chunyu Sun, Chenye Xu, Chengyuan Yao, Siyuan Liang, Yichao Wu, Ding Liang, XiangLong Liu, Aishan Liu

**Abstracts**: Adversarial training (AT) methods are effective against adversarial attacks, yet they introduce severe disparity of accuracy and robustness between different classes, known as the robust fairness problem. Previously proposed Fair Robust Learning (FRL) adaptively reweights different classes to improve fairness. However, the performance of the better-performed classes decreases, leading to a strong performance drop. In this paper, we observed two unfair phenomena during adversarial training: different difficulties in generating adversarial examples from each class (source-class fairness) and disparate target class tendencies when generating adversarial examples (target-class fairness). From the observations, we propose Balance Adversarial Training (BAT) to address the robust fairness problem. Regarding source-class fairness, we adjust the attack strength and difficulties of each class to generate samples near the decision boundary for easier and fairer model learning; considering target-class fairness, by introducing a uniform distribution constraint, we encourage the adversarial example generation process for each class with a fair tendency. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNette) demonstrate that our method can significantly outperform other baselines in mitigating the robust fairness problem (+5-10\% on the worst class accuracy)

**Authors**: Yucheng Shi, Yahong Han, Yu-an Tan, Xiaohui Kuang

**Abstracts**: Vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated impressive performance and stronger adversarial robustness compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). On the one hand, ViTs' focus on global interaction between individual patches reduces the local noise sensitivity of images. On the other hand, the neglect of noise sensitivity differences between image regions by existing decision-based attacks further compromises the efficiency of noise compression, especially for ViTs. Therefore, validating the black-box adversarial robustness of ViTs when the target model can only be queried still remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the limitations of existing decision-based attacks from the perspective of noise sensitivity difference between regions of the image, and propose a new decision-based black-box attack against ViTs, termed Patch-wise Adversarial Removal (PAR). PAR divides images into patches through a coarse-to-fine search process and compresses the noise on each patch separately. PAR records the noise magnitude and noise sensitivity of each patch and selects the patch with the highest query value for noise compression. In addition, PAR can be used as a noise initialization method for other decision-based attacks to improve the noise compression efficiency on both ViTs and CNNs without introducing additional calculations. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that PAR achieves a much lower noise magnitude with the same number of queries.

**Abstracts**: Despite recent success of self-supervised based contrastive learning model for 3D point clouds representation, the adversarial robustness of such pre-trained models raised concerns. Adversarial contrastive learning (ACL) is considered an effective way to improve the robustness of pre-trained models. In contrastive learning, the projector is considered an effective component for removing unnecessary feature information during contrastive pretraining and most ACL works also use contrastive loss with projected feature representations to generate adversarial examples in pretraining, while "unprojected " feature representations are used in generating adversarial inputs during inference.Because of the distribution gap between projected and "unprojected" features, their models are constrained of obtaining robust feature representations for downstream tasks. We introduce a new method to generate high-quality 3D adversarial examples for adversarial training by utilizing virtual adversarial loss with "unprojected" feature representations in contrastive learning framework. We present our robust aware loss function to train self-supervised contrastive learning framework adversarially. Furthermore, we find selecting high difference points with the Difference of Normal (DoN) operator as additional input for adversarial self-supervised contrastive learning can significantly improve the adversarial robustness of the pre-trained model. We validate our method, PointACL on downstream tasks, including 3D classification and 3D segmentation with multiple datasets. It obtains comparable robust accuracy over state-of-the-art contrastive adversarial learning methods.

**Abstracts**: Benefiting from large-scale Pretrained Vision-Language Models (VL-PMs), the performance of Visual Question Answering (VQA) has started to approach human oracle performance. However, finetuning large-scale VL-PMs with limited data for VQA usually faces overfitting and poor generalization issues, leading to a lack of robustness. In this paper, we aim to improve the robustness of VQA systems (ie, the ability of the systems to defend against input variations and human-adversarial attacks) from the perspective of Information Bottleneck when finetuning VL-PMs for VQA. Generally, internal representations obtained by VL-PMs inevitably contain irrelevant and redundant information for the downstream VQA task, resulting in statistically spurious correlations and insensitivity to input variations. To encourage representations to converge to a minimal sufficient statistic in vision-language learning, we propose the Correlation Information Bottleneck (CIB) principle, which seeks a tradeoff between representation compression and redundancy by minimizing the mutual information (MI) between the inputs and internal representations while maximizing the MI between the outputs and the representations. Meanwhile, CIB measures the internal correlations among visual and linguistic inputs and representations by a symmetrized joint MI estimation. Extensive experiments on five VQA benchmarks of input robustness and two VQA benchmarks of human-adversarial robustness demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed CIB in improving the robustness of VQA systems.

**Abstracts**: In recent years novel architecture components for image classification have been developed, starting with attention and patches used in transformers. While prior works have analyzed the influence of some aspects of architecture components on the robustness to adversarial attacks, in particular for vision transformers, the understanding of the main factors is still limited. We compare several (non)-robust classifiers with different architectures and study their properties, including the effect of adversarial training on the interpretability of the learnt features and robustness to unseen threat models. An ablation from ResNet to ConvNeXt reveals key architectural changes leading to almost $10\%$ higher $\ell_\infty$-robustness.

**Abstracts**: Constrained reinforcement learning is to maximize the expected reward subject to constraints on utilities/costs. However, the training environment may not be the same as the test one, due to, e.g., modeling error, adversarial attack, non-stationarity, resulting in severe performance degradation and more importantly constraint violation. We propose a framework of robust constrained reinforcement learning under model uncertainty, where the MDP is not fixed but lies in some uncertainty set, the goal is to guarantee that constraints on utilities/costs are satisfied for all MDPs in the uncertainty set, and to maximize the worst-case reward performance over the uncertainty set. We design a robust primal-dual approach, and further theoretically develop guarantee on its convergence, complexity and robust feasibility. We then investigate a concrete example of $\delta$-contamination uncertainty set, design an online and model-free algorithm and theoretically characterize its sample complexity.
