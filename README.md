cs.CL

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-05    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02632v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02632v1)

**Authors**: Muxi Diao, Rumei Li, Shiyang Liu, Guogang Liao, Jingang Wang, Xunliang Cai, Weiran Xu

**Abstract**: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance in capability and influence, ensuring their security and preventing harmful outputs has become crucial. A promising approach to address these concerns involves training models to automatically generate adversarial prompts for red teaming. However, the evolving subtlety of vulnerabilities in LLMs challenges the effectiveness of current adversarial methods, which struggle to specifically target and explore the weaknesses of these models. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the $\mathbf{S}\text{elf-}\mathbf{E}\text{volving }\mathbf{A}\text{dversarial }\mathbf{S}\text{afety }\mathbf{(SEAS)}$ optimization framework, which enhances security by leveraging data generated by the model itself. SEAS operates through three iterative stages: Initialization, Attack, and Adversarial Optimization, refining both the Red Team and Target models to improve robustness and safety. This framework reduces reliance on manual testing and significantly enhances the security capabilities of LLMs. Our contributions include a novel adversarial framework, a comprehensive safety dataset, and after three iterations, the Target model achieves a security level comparable to GPT-4, while the Red Team model shows a marked increase in attack success rate (ASR) against advanced models.

arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2303.01351

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-05    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11515v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11515v2)

**Authors**: Amira Guesmi, Muhammad Abdullah Hanif, Ihsen Alouani, Bassem Ouni, Muhammad Shafique

**Abstract**: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) has advanced significantly, primarily through the integration of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and more recently, Transformers. However, concerns about their susceptibility to adversarial attacks have emerged, especially in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving and robotic navigation. Existing approaches for assessing CNN-based depth prediction methods have fallen short in inducing comprehensive disruptions to the vision system, often limited to specific local areas. In this paper, we introduce SSAP (Shape-Sensitive Adversarial Patch), a novel approach designed to comprehensively disrupt monocular depth estimation (MDE) in autonomous navigation applications. Our patch is crafted to selectively undermine MDE in two distinct ways: by distorting estimated distances or by creating the illusion of an object disappearing from the system's perspective. Notably, our patch is shape-sensitive, meaning it considers the specific shape and scale of the target object, thereby extending its influence beyond immediate proximity. Furthermore, our patch is trained to effectively address different scales and distances from the camera. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach induces a mean depth estimation error surpassing 0.5, impacting up to 99% of the targeted region for CNN-based MDE models. Additionally, we investigate the vulnerability of Transformer-based MDE models to patch-based attacks, revealing that SSAP yields a significant error of 0.59 and exerts substantial influence over 99% of the target region on these models.



## **3. APARATE: Adaptive Adversarial Patch for CNN-based Monocular Depth Estimation for Autonomous Navigation**

cs.CV

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-05    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01351v3) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.01351v3)

**Authors**: Amira Guesmi, Muhammad Abdullah Hanif, Ihsen Alouani, Muhammad Shafique

**Abstract**: In recent times, monocular depth estimation (MDE) has experienced significant advancements in performance, largely attributed to the integration of innovative architectures, i.e., convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers. Nevertheless, the susceptibility of these models to adversarial attacks has emerged as a noteworthy concern, especially in domains where safety and security are paramount. This concern holds particular weight for MDE due to its critical role in applications like autonomous driving and robotic navigation, where accurate scene understanding is pivotal. To assess the vulnerability of CNN-based depth prediction methods, recent work tries to design adversarial patches against MDE. However, the existing approaches fall short of inducing a comprehensive and substantially disruptive impact on the vision system. Instead, their influence is partial and confined to specific local areas. These methods lead to erroneous depth predictions only within the overlapping region with the input image, without considering the characteristics of the target object, such as its size, shape, and position. In this paper, we introduce a novel adversarial patch named APARATE. This patch possesses the ability to selectively undermine MDE in two distinct ways: by distorting the estimated distances or by creating the illusion of an object disappearing from the perspective of the autonomous system. Notably, APARATE is designed to be sensitive to the shape and scale of the target object, and its influence extends beyond immediate proximity. APARATE, results in a mean depth estimation error surpassing $0.5$, significantly impacting as much as $99\%$ of the targeted region when applied to CNN-based MDE models. Furthermore, it yields a significant error of $0.34$ and exerts substantial influence over $94\%$ of the target region in the context of Transformer-based MDE.



## **4. Open Sesame! Universal Black Box Jailbreaking of Large Language Models**

cs.CL

Accepted at SeT-LLM @ ICLR 2024

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-05    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01446v4) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.01446v4)

**Authors**: Raz Lapid, Ron Langberg, Moshe Sipper

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs), designed to provide helpful and safe responses, often rely on alignment techniques to align with user intent and social guidelines. Unfortunately, this alignment can be exploited by malicious actors seeking to manipulate an LLM's outputs for unintended purposes. In this paper we introduce a novel approach that employs a genetic algorithm (GA) to manipulate LLMs when model architecture and parameters are inaccessible. The GA attack works by optimizing a universal adversarial prompt that -- when combined with a user's query -- disrupts the attacked model's alignment, resulting in unintended and potentially harmful outputs. Our novel approach systematically reveals a model's limitations and vulnerabilities by uncovering instances where its responses deviate from expected behavior. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate the efficacy of our technique, thus contributing to the ongoing discussion on responsible AI development by providing a diagnostic tool for evaluating and enhancing alignment of LLMs with human intent. To our knowledge this is the first automated universal black box jailbreak attack.

This is the full version of the paper with the same title to appear  in the proceedings of the 2024 Workshop on Security and Artificial  Intelligence (SECAI 2024)

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-05    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02310v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02310v1)

**Authors**: Muhammad Salman, Benjamin Zi Hao Zhao, Hassan Jameel Asghar, Muhammad Ikram, Sidharth Kaushik, Mohamed Ali Kaafar

**Abstract**: Adversarial examples add imperceptible alterations to inputs with the objective to induce misclassification in machine learning models. They have been demonstrated to pose significant challenges in domains like image classification, with results showing that an adversarially perturbed image to evade detection against one classifier is most likely transferable to other classifiers. Adversarial examples have also been studied in malware analysis. Unlike images, program binaries cannot be arbitrarily perturbed without rendering them non-functional. Due to the difficulty of crafting adversarial program binaries, there is no consensus on the transferability of adversarially perturbed programs to different detectors. In this work, we explore the robustness of malware detectors against adversarially perturbed malware. We investigate the transferability of adversarial attacks developed against one detector, against other machine learning-based malware detectors, and code similarity techniques, specifically, locality sensitive hashing-based detectors. Our analysis reveals that adversarial program binaries crafted for one detector are generally less effective against others. We also evaluate an ensemble of detectors and show that they can potentially mitigate the impact of adversarial program binaries. Finally, we demonstrate that substantial program changes made to evade detection may result in the transformation technique being identified, implying that the adversary must make minimal changes to the program binary.



## **6. Model Hijacking Attack in Federated Learning**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-04    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02131v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02131v1)

**Authors**: Zheng Li, Siyuan Wu, Ruichuan Chen, Paarijaat Aditya, Istemi Ekin Akkus, Manohar Vanga, Min Zhang, Hao Li, Yang Zhang

**Abstract**: Machine learning (ML), driven by prominent paradigms such as centralized and federated learning, has made significant progress in various critical applications ranging from autonomous driving to face recognition. However, its remarkable success has been accompanied by various attacks. Recently, the model hijacking attack has shown that ML models can be hijacked to execute tasks different from their original tasks, which increases both accountability and parasitic computational risks. Nevertheless, thus far, this attack has only focused on centralized learning. In this work, we broaden the scope of this attack to the federated learning domain, where multiple clients collaboratively train a global model without sharing their data. Specifically, we present HijackFL, the first-of-its-kind hijacking attack against the global model in federated learning. The adversary aims to force the global model to perform a different task (called hijacking task) from its original task without the server or benign client noticing. To accomplish this, unlike existing methods that use data poisoning to modify the target model's parameters, HijackFL searches for pixel-level perturbations based on their local model (without modifications) to align hijacking samples with the original ones in the feature space. When performing the hijacking task, the adversary applies these cloaks to the hijacking samples, compelling the global model to identify them as original samples and predict them accordingly. We conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets and three popular models. Empirical results demonstrate that its attack performance outperforms baselines. We further investigate the factors that affect its performance and discuss possible defenses to mitigate its impact.



## **7. LLM Lies: Hallucinations are not Bugs, but Features as Adversarial Examples**

cs.CL

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-04    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01469v3) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01469v3)

**Authors**: Jia-Yu Yao, Kun-Peng Ning, Zhen-Hui Liu, Mu-Nan Ning, Yu-Yang Liu, Li Yuan

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-3.5, LLaMA, and PaLM, seem to be knowledgeable and able to adapt to many tasks. However, we still cannot completely trust their answers, since LLMs suffer from \textbf{hallucination}\textemdash fabricating non-existent facts, deceiving users with or without their awareness. However, the reasons for their existence and pervasiveness remain unclear. In this paper, we demonstrate that nonsensical prompts composed of random tokens can also elicit the LLMs to respond with hallucinations. Moreover, we provide both theoretical and experimental evidence that transformers can be manipulated to produce specific pre-define tokens by perturbing its input sequence. This phenomenon forces us to revisit that \emph{hallucination may be another view of adversarial examples}, and it shares similar characteristics with conventional adversarial examples as a basic property of LLMs. Therefore, we formalize an automatic hallucination triggering method as the \textit{hallucination attack} in an adversarial way. Finally, we explore the basic properties of attacked adversarial prompts and propose a simple yet effective defense strategy. Our code is released on GitHub\footnote{https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/Hallucination-Attack}.



## **8. AdvQDet: Detecting Query-Based Adversarial Attacks with Adversarial Contrastive Prompt Tuning**

cs.CV

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-04    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01978v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01978v1)

**Authors**: Xin Wang, Kai Chen, Xingjun Ma, Zhineng Chen, Jingjing Chen, Yu-Gang Jiang

**Abstract**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks even under a black-box setting where the adversary can only query the model. Particularly, query-based black-box adversarial attacks estimate adversarial gradients based on the returned probability vectors of the target model for a sequence of queries. During this process, the queries made to the target model are intermediate adversarial examples crafted at the previous attack step, which share high similarities in the pixel space. Motivated by this observation, stateful detection methods have been proposed to detect and reject query-based attacks. While demonstrating promising results, these methods either have been evaded by more advanced attacks or suffer from low efficiency in terms of the number of shots (queries) required to detect different attacks. Arguably, the key challenge here is to assign high similarity scores for any two intermediate adversarial examples perturbed from the same clean image. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Adversarial Contrastive Prompt Tuning (ACPT) method to robustly fine-tune the CLIP image encoder to extract similar embeddings for any two intermediate adversarial queries. With ACPT, we further introduce a detection framework AdvQDet that can detect 7 state-of-the-art query-based attacks with $>99\%$ detection rate within 5 shots. We also show that ACPT is robust to 3 types of adaptive attacks. Code is available at https://github.com/xinwong/AdvQDet.



## **9. Label Augmentation for Neural Networks Robustness**

cs.CV

21 pages, 4 figures, Published at 3rd Conference on Lifelong Learning  Agents (CoLLAs), 2024

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-04    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01977v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01977v1)

**Authors**: Fatemeh Amerehi, Patrick Healy

**Abstract**: Out-of-distribution generalization can be categorized into two types: common perturbations arising from natural variations in the real world and adversarial perturbations that are intentionally crafted to deceive neural networks. While deep neural networks excel in accuracy under the assumption of identical distributions between training and test data, they often encounter out-of-distribution scenarios resulting in a significant decline in accuracy. Data augmentation methods can effectively enhance robustness against common corruptions, but they typically fall short in improving robustness against adversarial perturbations. In this study, we develop Label Augmentation (LA), which enhances robustness against both common and intentional perturbations and improves uncertainty estimation. Our findings indicate a Clean error rate improvement of up to 23.29% when employing LA in comparisons to the baseline. Additionally, it enhances robustness under common corruptions benchmark by up to 24.23%. When tested against FGSM and PGD attacks, improvements in adversarial robustness are noticeable, with enhancements of up to 53.18% for FGSM and 24.46% for PGD attacks.



## **10. Top K Enhanced Reinforcement Learning Attacks on Heterogeneous Graph Node Classification**

cs.LG

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-04    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01964v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01964v1)

**Authors**: Honglin Gao, Gaoxi Xiao

**Abstract**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have attracted substantial interest due to their exceptional performance on graph-based data. However, their robustness, especially on heterogeneous graphs, remains underexplored, particularly against adversarial attacks. This paper proposes HeteroKRLAttack, a targeted evasion black-box attack method for heterogeneous graphs. By integrating reinforcement learning with a Top-K algorithm to reduce the action space, our method efficiently identifies effective attack strategies to disrupt node classification tasks. We validate the effectiveness of HeteroKRLAttack through experiments on multiple heterogeneous graph datasets, showing significant reductions in classification accuracy compared to baseline methods. An ablation study underscores the critical role of the Top-K algorithm in enhancing attack performance. Our findings highlight potential vulnerabilities in current models and provide guidance for future defense strategies against adversarial attacks on heterogeneous graphs.



## **11. A Survey and Evaluation of Adversarial Attacks for Object Detection**

cs.CV

14 pages

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-04    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01934v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01934v1)

**Authors**: Khoi Nguyen Tiet Nguyen, Wenyu Zhang, Kangkang Lu, Yuhuan Wu, Xingjian Zheng, Hui Li Tan, Liangli Zhen

**Abstract**: Deep learning models excel in various computer vision tasks but are susceptible to adversarial examples-subtle perturbations in input data that lead to incorrect predictions. This vulnerability poses significant risks in safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles, security surveillance, and aircraft health monitoring. While numerous surveys focus on adversarial attacks in image classification, the literature on such attacks in object detection is limited. This paper offers a comprehensive taxonomy of adversarial attacks specific to object detection, reviews existing adversarial robustness evaluation metrics, and systematically assesses open-source attack methods and model robustness. Key observations are provided to enhance the understanding of attack effectiveness and corresponding countermeasures. Additionally, we identify crucial research challenges to guide future efforts in securing automated object detection systems.



## **12. Sharpness-Aware Cross-Domain Recommendation to Cold-Start Users**

cs.IR

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-04    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01931v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01931v1)

**Authors**: Guohang Zeng, Qian Zhang, Guangquan Zhang, Jie Lu

**Abstract**: Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) is a promising paradigm inspired by transfer learning to solve the cold-start problem in recommender systems. Existing state-of-the-art CDR methods train an explicit mapping function to transfer the cold-start users from a data-rich source domain to a target domain. However, a limitation of these methods is that the mapping function is trained on overlapping users across domains, while only a small number of overlapping users are available for training. By visualizing the loss landscape of the existing CDR model, we find that training on a small number of overlapping users causes the model to converge to sharp minima, leading to poor generalization. Based on this observation, we leverage loss-geometry-based machine learning approach and propose a novel CDR method called Sharpness-Aware CDR (SCDR). Our proposed method simultaneously optimizes recommendation loss and loss sharpness, leading to better generalization with theoretical guarantees. Empirical studies on real-world datasets demonstrate that SCDR significantly outperforms the other CDR models for cold-start recommendation tasks, while concurrently enhancing the model's robustness to adversarial attacks.



## **13. State-dependent Filtering of the Ring Model**

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-03    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01817v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01817v1)

**Authors**: Jing Yan, Yunxuan Feng, Wei Dai, Yaoyu Zhang

**Abstract**: Robustness is a measure of functional reliability of a system against perturbations. To achieve a good and robust performance, a system must filter out external perturbations by its internal priors. These priors are usually distilled in the structure and the states of the system. Biophysical neural network are known to be robust but the exact mechanisms are still elusive. In this paper, we probe how orientation-selective neurons organized on a 1-D ring network respond to perturbations in the hope of gaining some insights on the robustness of visual system in brain. We analyze the steady-state of the rate-based network and prove that the activation state of neurons, rather than their firing rates, determines how the model respond to perturbations. We then identify specific perturbation patterns that induce the largest responses for different configurations of activation states, and find them to be sinusoidal or sinusoidal-like while other patterns are largely attenuated. Similar results are observed in a spiking ring model. Finally, we remap the perturbations in orientation back into the 2-D image space using Gabor functions. The resulted optimal perturbation patterns mirror adversarial attacks in deep learning that exploit the priors of the system. Our results suggest that based on different state configurations, these priors could underlie some of the illusionary experiences as the cost of visual robustness.



## **14. ALIF: Low-Cost Adversarial Audio Attacks on Black-Box Speech Platforms using Linguistic Features**

cs.CR

Published in the 2024 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP)

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-03    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01808v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01808v1)

**Authors**: Peng Cheng, Yuwei Wang, Peng Huang, Zhongjie Ba, Xiaodong Lin, Feng Lin, Li Lu, Kui Ren

**Abstract**: Extensive research has revealed that adversarial examples (AE) pose a significant threat to voice-controllable smart devices. Recent studies have proposed black-box adversarial attacks that require only the final transcription from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. However, these attacks typically involve many queries to the ASR, resulting in substantial costs. Moreover, AE-based adversarial audio samples are susceptible to ASR updates. In this paper, we identify the root cause of these limitations, namely the inability to construct AE attack samples directly around the decision boundary of deep learning (DL) models. Building on this observation, we propose ALIF, the first black-box adversarial linguistic feature-based attack pipeline. We leverage the reciprocal process of text-to-speech (TTS) and ASR models to generate perturbations in the linguistic embedding space where the decision boundary resides. Based on the ALIF pipeline, we present the ALIF-OTL and ALIF-OTA schemes for launching attacks in both the digital domain and the physical playback environment on four commercial ASRs and voice assistants. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ALIF-OTL and -OTA significantly improve query efficiency by 97.7% and 73.3%, respectively, while achieving competitive performance compared to existing methods. Notably, ALIF-OTL can generate an attack sample with only one query. Furthermore, our test-of-time experiment validates the robustness of our approach against ASR updates.



## **15. Joint Universal Adversarial Perturbations with Interpretations**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-03    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01715v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01715v1)

**Authors**: Liang-bo Ning, Zeyu Dai, Wenqi Fan, Jingran Su, Chao Pan, Luning Wang, Qing Li

**Abstract**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have significantly boosted the performance of many challenging tasks. Despite the great development, DNNs have also exposed their vulnerability. Recent studies have shown that adversaries can manipulate the predictions of DNNs by adding a universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) to benign samples. On the other hand, increasing efforts have been made to help users understand and explain the inner working of DNNs by highlighting the most informative parts (i.e., attribution maps) of samples with respect to their predictions. Moreover, we first empirically find that such attribution maps between benign and adversarial examples have a significant discrepancy, which has the potential to detect universal adversarial perturbations for defending against adversarial attacks. This finding motivates us to further investigate a new research problem: whether there exist universal adversarial perturbations that are able to jointly attack DNNs classifier and its interpretation with malicious desires. It is challenging to give an explicit answer since these two objectives are seemingly conflicting. In this paper, we propose a novel attacking framework to generate joint universal adversarial perturbations (JUAP), which can fool the DNNs model and misguide the inspection from interpreters simultaneously. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method JUAP for joint attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to study UAP for jointly attacking both DNNs and interpretations.



## **16. Downstream Transfer Attack: Adversarial Attacks on Downstream Models with Pre-trained Vision Transformers**

cs.CV

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-03    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01705v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01705v1)

**Authors**: Weijie Zheng, Xingjun Ma, Hanxun Huang, Zuxuan Wu, Yu-Gang Jiang

**Abstract**: With the advancement of vision transformers (ViTs) and self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques, pre-trained large ViTs have become the new foundation models for computer vision applications. However, studies have shown that, like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), ViTs are also susceptible to adversarial attacks, where subtle perturbations in the input can fool the model into making false predictions. This paper studies the transferability of such an adversarial vulnerability from a pre-trained ViT model to downstream tasks. We focus on \emph{sample-wise} transfer attacks and propose a novel attack method termed \emph{Downstream Transfer Attack (DTA)}. For a given test image, DTA leverages a pre-trained ViT model to craft the adversarial example and then applies the adversarial example to attack a fine-tuned version of the model on a downstream dataset. During the attack, DTA identifies and exploits the most vulnerable layers of the pre-trained model guided by a cosine similarity loss to craft highly transferable attacks. Through extensive experiments with pre-trained ViTs by 3 distinct pre-training methods, 3 fine-tuning schemes, and across 10 diverse downstream datasets, we show that DTA achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) exceeding 90\%, surpassing existing methods by a huge margin. When used with adversarial training, the adversarial examples generated by our DTA can significantly improve the model's robustness to different downstream transfer attacks.



## **17. Enhancing Tracking Robustness with Auxiliary Adversarial Defense Networks**

This paper is accepted by ECCV2024

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-03    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17976v3) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17976v3)

**Authors**: Zhewei Wu, Ruilong Yu, Qihe Liu, Shuying Cheng, Shilin Qiu, Shijie Zhou

**Abstract**: Adversarial attacks in visual object tracking have significantly degraded the performance of advanced trackers by introducing imperceptible perturbations into images. However, there is still a lack of research on designing adversarial defense methods for object tracking. To address these issues, we propose an effective auxiliary pre-processing defense network, AADN, which performs defensive transformations on the input images before feeding them into the tracker. Moreover, it can be seamlessly integrated with other visual trackers as a plug-and-play module without parameter adjustments. We train AADN using adversarial training, specifically employing Dua-Loss to generate adversarial samples that simultaneously attack the classification and regression branches of the tracker. Extensive experiments conducted on the OTB100, LaSOT, and VOT2018 benchmarks demonstrate that AADN maintains excellent defense robustness against adversarial attack methods in both adaptive and non-adaptive attack scenarios. Moreover, when transferring the defense network to heterogeneous trackers, it exhibits reliable transferability. Finally, AADN achieves a processing time of up to 5ms/frame, allowing seamless integration with existing high-speed trackers without introducing significant computational overhead.

PhD thesis

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-02    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01596v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01596v1)

**Authors**: Han Shao

**Abstract**: Machine learning has witnessed remarkable breakthroughs in recent years. As machine learning permeates various aspects of daily life, individuals and organizations increasingly interact with these systems, exhibiting a wide range of social and adversarial behaviors. These behaviors may have a notable impact on the behavior and performance of machine learning systems. Specifically, during these interactions, data may be generated by strategic individuals, collected by self-interested data collectors, possibly poisoned by adversarial attackers, and used to create predictors, models, and policies satisfying multiple objectives. As a result, the machine learning systems' outputs might degrade, such as the susceptibility of deep neural networks to adversarial examples (Shafahi et al., 2018; Szegedy et al., 2013) and the diminished performance of classic algorithms in the presence of strategic individuals (Ahmadi et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is imperative for the success of machine learning in societal settings.

**Authors**: Alexander Gushchin, Khaled Abud, Georgii Bychkov, Ekaterina Shumitskaya, Anna Chistyakova, Sergey Lavrushkin, Bader Rasheed, Kirill Malyshev, Dmitriy Vatolin, Anastasia Antsiferova

**Abstract**: In the field of Image Quality Assessment (IQA), the adversarial robustness of the metrics poses a critical concern. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmarking study of various defense mechanisms in response to the rise in adversarial attacks on IQA. We systematically evaluate 25 defense strategies, including adversarial purification, adversarial training, and certified robustness methods. We applied 14 adversarial attack algorithms of various types in both non-adaptive and adaptive settings and tested these defenses against them. We analyze the differences between defenses and their applicability to IQA tasks, considering that they should preserve IQA scores and image quality. The proposed benchmark aims to guide future developments and accepts submissions of new methods, with the latest results available online: https://videoprocessing.ai/benchmarks/iqa-defenses.html.

**Authors**: Arun Prakash R, Anwesha Bhattacharyya, Joel Vaughan, Vijayan N. Nair

**Abstract**: As machine learning models become increasingly prevalent in critical decision-making models and systems in fields like finance, healthcare, etc., ensuring their robustness against adversarial attacks and changes in the input data is paramount, especially in cases where models potentially overfit. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for assessing the robustness of machine learning models through covariate perturbation techniques. We explore various perturbation strategies to assess robustness and examine their impact on model predictions, including separate strategies for numeric and non-numeric variables, summaries of perturbations to assess and compare model robustness across different scenarios, and local robustness diagnosis to identify any regions in the data where a model is particularly unstable. Through empirical studies on real world dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in comparing robustness across models, identifying the instabilities in the model, and enhancing model robustness.



## **21. Revisiting the Robust Alignment of Circuit Breakers**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2024-08-02    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15902v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15902v2)

**Authors**: Leo Schwinn, Simon Geisler

**Abstract**: Over the past decade, adversarial training has emerged as one of the few reliable methods for enhancing model robustness against adversarial attacks [Szegedy et al., 2014, Madry et al., 2018, Xhonneux et al., 2024], while many alternative approaches have failed to withstand rigorous subsequent evaluations. Recently, an alternative defense mechanism, namely "circuit breakers" [Zou et al., 2024], has shown promising results for aligning LLMs. In this report, we show that the robustness claims of "Improving Alignment and Robustness with Circuit Breakers" against unconstraint continuous attacks in the embedding space of the input tokens may be overestimated [Zou et al., 2024]. Specifically, we demonstrate that by implementing a few simple changes to embedding space attacks [Schwinn et al., 2024a,b], we achieve 100% attack success rate (ASR) against circuit breaker models. Without conducting any further hyperparameter tuning, these adjustments increase the ASR by more than 80% compared to the original evaluation.

**Authors**: Róisín Luo, James McDermott, Colm O'Riordan

**Abstract**: Perturbation robustness evaluates the vulnerabilities of models, arising from a variety of perturbations, such as data corruptions and adversarial attacks. Understanding the mechanisms of perturbation robustness is critical for global interpretability. We present a model-agnostic, global mechanistic interpretability method to interpret the perturbation robustness of image models. This research is motivated by two key aspects. First, previous global interpretability works, in tandem with robustness benchmarks, e.g. mean corruption error (mCE), are not designed to directly interpret the mechanisms of perturbation robustness within image models. Second, we notice that the spectral signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of perturbed natural images exponentially decay over the frequency. This power-law-like decay implies that: Low-frequency signals are generally more robust than high-frequency signals -- yet high classification accuracy can not be achieved by low-frequency signals alone. By applying Shapley value theory, our method axiomatically quantifies the predictive powers of robust features and non-robust features within an information theory framework. Our method, dubbed as \textbf{I-ASIDE} (\textbf{I}mage \textbf{A}xiomatic \textbf{S}pectral \textbf{I}mportance \textbf{D}ecomposition \textbf{E}xplanation), provides a unique insight into model robustness mechanisms. We conduct extensive experiments over a variety of vision models pre-trained on ImageNet to show that \textbf{I-ASIDE} can not only \textbf{measure} the perturbation robustness but also \textbf{provide interpretations} of its mechanisms.

**Authors**: Tung M. Luu, Haeyong Kang, Tri Ton, Thanh Nguyen, Chang D. Yoo

**Abstract**: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents demonstrating proficiency in a training environment exhibit vulnerability to adversarial perturbations in input observations during deployment. This underscores the importance of building a robust agent before its real-world deployment. To alleviate the challenging point, prior works focus on developing robust training-based procedures, encompassing efforts to fortify the deep neural network component's robustness or subject the agent to adversarial training against potent attacks. In this work, we propose a novel method referred to as Transformed Input-robust RL (TIRL), which explores another avenue to mitigate the impact of adversaries by employing input transformation-based defenses. Specifically, we introduce two principles for applying transformation-based defenses in learning robust RL agents: (1) autoencoder-styled denoising to reconstruct the original state and (2) bounded transformations (bit-depth reduction and vector quantization (VQ)) to achieve close transformed inputs. The transformations are applied to the state before feeding it into the policy network. Extensive experiments on multiple MuJoCo environments demonstrate that input transformation-based defenses, i.e., VQ, defend against several adversaries in the state observations.

**Authors**: Tarun Chitra, Mallesh Pai

**Abstract**: Restaking protocols have aggregated billions of dollars of security by utilizing token incentives and payments. A natural question to ask is: How much security do restaked services \emph{really} need to purchase? To answer this question, we expand a model of Durvasula and Roughgarden [DR24] that includes incentives and an expanded threat model consisting of strategic attackers and users. Our model shows that an adversary with a strictly submodular profit combined with strategic node operators who respond to incentives can avoid the large-scale cascading failures of~[DR24]. We utilize our model to construct an approximation algorithm for choosing token-based incentives that achieve a given security level against adversaries who are bounded in the number of services they can simultaneously attack. Our results suggest that incentivized restaking protocols can be secure with proper incentive management.

**Authors**: Tom Wollschläger, Aman Saxena, Nicola Franco, Jeanette Miriam Lorenz, Stephan Günnemann

**Abstract**: Breakthroughs in machine learning (ML) and advances in quantum computing (QC) drive the interdisciplinary field of quantum machine learning to new levels. However, due to the susceptibility of ML models to adversarial attacks, practical use raises safety-critical concerns. Existing Randomized Smoothing (RS) certification methods for classical machine learning models are computationally intensive. In this paper, we propose the combination of QC and the concept of discrete randomized smoothing to speed up the stochastic certification of ML models for discrete data. We show how to encode all the perturbations of the input binary data in superposition and use Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) to obtain a quadratic reduction in the number of calls to the model that are required compared to traditional randomized smoothing techniques. In addition, we propose a new binary threat model to allow for an extensive evaluation of our approach on images, graphs, and text.

**Authors**: Rishub Tamirisa, Bhrugu Bharathi, Long Phan, Andy Zhou, Alice Gatti, Tarun Suresh, Maxwell Lin, Justin Wang, Rowan Wang, Ron Arel, Andy Zou, Dawn Song, Bo Li, Dan Hendrycks, Mantas Mazeika

**Abstract**: Rapid advances in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have raised widespread concerns regarding their potential for malicious use. Open-weight LLMs present unique challenges, as existing safeguards lack robustness to tampering attacks that modify model weights. For example, recent works have demonstrated that refusal and unlearning safeguards can be trivially removed with a few steps of fine-tuning. These vulnerabilities necessitate new approaches for enabling the safe release of open-weight LLMs. We develop a method, called TAR, for building tamper-resistant safeguards into open-weight LLMs such that adversaries cannot remove the safeguards even after thousands of steps of fine-tuning. In extensive evaluations and red teaming analyses, we find that our method greatly improves tamper-resistance while preserving benign capabilities. Our results demonstrate that tamper-resistance is a tractable problem, opening up a promising new avenue to improve the safety and security of open-weight LLMs.

**Authors**: Zhuoqun Huang, Neil G Marchant, Olga Ohrimenko, Benjamin I. P. Rubinstein

**Abstract**: With the growing integration of AI in daily life, ensuring the robustness of systems to inference-time attacks is crucial. Among the approaches for certifying robustness to such adversarial examples, randomized smoothing has emerged as highly promising due to its nature as a wrapper around arbitrary black-box models. Previous work on randomized smoothing in natural language processing has primarily focused on specific subsets of edit distance operations, such as synonym substitution or word insertion, without exploring the certification of all edit operations. In this paper, we adapt Randomized Deletion (Huang et al., 2023) and propose, CERTified Edit Distance defense (CERT-ED) for natural language classification. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that CERT-ED outperforms the existing Hamming distance method RanMASK (Zeng et al., 2023) in 4 out of 5 datasets in terms of both accuracy and the cardinality of the certificate. By covering various threat models, including 5 direct and 5 transfer attacks, our method improves empirical robustness in 38 out of 50 settings.

**Authors**: Jan Hendrik Kirchner, Yining Chen, Harri Edwards, Jan Leike, Nat McAleese, Yuri Burda

**Abstract**: One way to increase confidence in the outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs) is to support them with reasoning that is clear and easy to check -- a property we call legibility. We study legibility in the context of solving grade-school math problems and show that optimizing chain-of-thought solutions only for answer correctness can make them less legible. To mitigate the loss in legibility, we propose a training algorithm inspired by Prover-Verifier Game from Anil et al. (2021). Our algorithm iteratively trains small verifiers to predict solution correctness, "helpful" provers to produce correct solutions that the verifier accepts, and "sneaky" provers to produce incorrect solutions that fool the verifier. We find that the helpful prover's accuracy and the verifier's robustness to adversarial attacks increase over the course of training. Furthermore, we show that legibility training transfers to time-constrained humans tasked with verifying solution correctness. Over course of LLM training human accuracy increases when checking the helpful prover's solutions, and decreases when checking the sneaky prover's solutions. Hence, training for checkability by small verifiers is a plausible technique for increasing output legibility. Our results suggest legibility training against small verifiers as a practical avenue for increasing legibility of large LLMs to humans, and thus could help with alignment of superhuman models.

**Authors**: Yue Xu, Xiuyuan Qi, Zhan Qin, Wenjie Wang

**Abstract**: Vision Language Models (VLMs) extend the capacity of LLMs to comprehensively understand vision information, achieving remarkable performance in many vision-centric tasks. Despite that, recent studies have shown that these models are susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which refer to an exploitative technique where malicious users can break the safety alignment of the target model and generate misleading and harmful answers. This potential threat is caused by both the inherent vulnerabilities of LLM and the larger attack scope introduced by vision input. To enhance the security of VLMs against jailbreak attacks, researchers have developed various defense techniques. However, these methods either require modifications to the model's internal structure or demand significant computational resources during the inference phase. Multimodal information is a double-edged sword. While it increases the risk of attacks, it also provides additional data that can enhance safeguards. Inspired by this, we propose $\underline{\textbf{C}}$ross-modality $\underline{\textbf{I}}$nformation $\underline{\textbf{DE}}$tecto$\underline{\textbf{R}}$ ($\textit{CIDER})$, a plug-and-play jailbreaking detector designed to identify maliciously perturbed image inputs, utilizing the cross-modal similarity between harmful queries and adversarial images. This simple yet effective cross-modality information detector, $\textit{CIDER}$, is independent of the target VLMs and requires less computation cost. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of $\textit{CIDER}$, as well as its transferability to both white-box and black-box VLMs.

**Authors**: Honglei Miao, Fan Ma, Ruijie Quan, Kun Zhan, Yi Yang

**Abstract**: Human motion generation driven by deep generative models has enabled compelling applications, but the ability of text-to-motion (T2M) models to produce realistic motions from text prompts raises security concerns if exploited maliciously. Despite growing interest in T2M, few methods focus on safeguarding these models against adversarial attacks, with existing work on text-to-image models proving insufficient for the unique motion domain. In the paper, we propose ALERT-Motion, an autonomous framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to craft targeted adversarial attacks against black-box T2M models. Unlike prior methods modifying prompts through predefined rules, ALERT-Motion uses LLMs' knowledge of human motion to autonomously generate subtle yet powerful adversarial text descriptions. It comprises two key modules: an adaptive dispatching module that constructs an LLM-based agent to iteratively refine and search for adversarial prompts; and a multimodal information contrastive module that extracts semantically relevant motion information to guide the agent's search. Through this LLM-driven approach, ALERT-Motion crafts adversarial prompts querying victim models to produce outputs closely matching targeted motions, while avoiding obvious perturbations. Evaluations across popular T2M models demonstrate ALERT-Motion's superiority over previous methods, achieving higher attack success rates with stealthier adversarial prompts. This pioneering work on T2M adversarial attacks highlights the urgency of developing defensive measures as motion generation technology advances, urging further research into safe and responsible deployment.

**Authors**: Angona Biswas, MD Abdullah Al Nasim, Kishor Datta Gupta, Roy George, Abdur Rashid

**Abstract**: Machine learning (ML) is a rapidly developing area of medicine that uses significant resources to apply computer science and statistics to medical issues. ML's proponents laud its capacity to handle vast, complicated, and erratic medical data. It's common knowledge that attackers might cause misclassification by deliberately creating inputs for machine learning classifiers. Research on adversarial examples has been extensively conducted in the field of computer vision applications. Healthcare systems are thought to be highly difficult because of the security and life-or-death considerations they include, and performance accuracy is very important. Recent arguments have suggested that adversarial attacks could be made against medical image analysis (MedIA) technologies because of the accompanying technology infrastructure and powerful financial incentives. Since the diagnosis will be the basis for important decisions, it is essential to assess how strong medical DNN tasks are against adversarial attacks. Simple adversarial attacks have been taken into account in several earlier studies. However, DNNs are susceptible to more risky and realistic attacks. The present paper covers recent proposed adversarial attack strategies against DNNs for medical imaging as well as countermeasures. In this study, we review current techniques for adversarial imaging attacks, detections. It also encompasses various facets of these techniques and offers suggestions for the robustness of neural networks to be improved in the future.

**Authors**: Arkaprava Sain, Sunandan Adhikary, Ipsita Koley, Soumyajit Dey

**Abstract**: Modern Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) consist of numerous control units interconnected by communication networks. Each control unit executes multiple safety-critical and non-critical tasks in real-time. Most of the safety-critical tasks are executed with a fixed sampling period to ensure deterministic timing behaviour that helps in its safety and performance analysis. However, adversaries can exploit this deterministic behaviour of safety-critical tasks to launch inference-based-based attacks on them. This paper aims to prevent and minimize the possibility of such timing inference or schedule-based attacks to compromise the control units. This is done by switching between strategically chosen execution rates of the safety-critical control tasks such that their performance remains unhampered. Thereafter, we present a novel schedule vulnerability analysis methodology to switch between valid schedules generated for these multiple periodicities of the control tasks in run time. Utilizing these strategies, we introduce a novel Multi-Rate Attack-Aware Randomized Scheduling (MAARS) framework for preemptive fixed-priority schedulers that minimize the success rate of timing-inference-based attacks on safety-critical real-time systems. To our knowledge, this is the first work to propose a schedule randomization method with attack awareness that preserves both the control and scheduling aspects. The efficacy of the framework in terms of attack prevention is finally evaluated on several automotive benchmarks in a Hardware-in-loop (HiL) environment.

**Authors**: Kuo Gai, Sicong Wang, Shihua Zhang

**Abstract**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to small adversarial perturbations of the inputs, posing a significant challenge to their reliability and robustness. Empirical methods such as adversarial training can defend against particular attacks but remain vulnerable to more powerful attacks. Alternatively, Lipschitz networks provide certified robustness to unseen perturbations but lack sufficient expressive power. To harness the advantages of both approaches, we design a novel two-step Optimal Transport induced Adversarial Defense (OTAD) model that can fit the training data accurately while preserving the local Lipschitz continuity. First, we train a DNN with a regularizer derived from optimal transport theory, yielding a discrete optimal transport map linking data to its features. By leveraging the map's inherent regularity, we interpolate the map by solving the convex integration problem (CIP) to guarantee the local Lipschitz property. OTAD is extensible to diverse architectures of ResNet and Transformer, making it suitable for complex data. For efficient computation, the CIP can be solved through training neural networks. OTAD opens a novel avenue for developing reliable and secure deep learning systems through the regularity of optimal transport maps. Empirical results demonstrate that OTAD can outperform other robust models on diverse datasets.

**Authors**: Xiao Li, Wenxuan Sun, Huanran Chen, Qiongxiu Li, Yining Liu, Yingzhe He, Jie Shi, Xiaolin Hu

**Abstract**: Recently Diffusion-based Purification (DiffPure) has been recognized as an effective defense method against adversarial examples. However, we find DiffPure which directly employs the original pre-trained diffusion models for adversarial purification, to be suboptimal. This is due to an inherent trade-off between noise purification performance and data recovery quality. Additionally, the reliability of existing evaluations for DiffPure is questionable, as they rely on weak adaptive attacks. In this work, we propose a novel Adversarial Diffusion Bridge Model, termed ADBM. ADBM directly constructs a reverse bridge from the diffused adversarial data back to its original clean examples, enhancing the purification capabilities of the original diffusion models. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation across various scenarios, ADBM has proven to be a superior and robust defense mechanism, offering significant promise for practical applications.

**Authors**: Sejoon Oh, Gaurav Verma, Srijan Kumar

**Abstract**: Text-aware recommender systems incorporate rich textual features, such as titles and descriptions, to generate item recommendations for users. The use of textual features helps mitigate cold-start problems, and thus, such recommender systems have attracted increased attention. However, we argue that the dependency on item descriptions makes the recommender system vulnerable to manipulation by adversarial sellers on e-commerce platforms. In this paper, we explore the possibility of such manipulation by proposing a new text rewriting framework to attack text-aware recommender systems. We show that the rewriting attack can be exploited by sellers to unfairly uprank their products, even though the adversarially rewritten descriptions are perceived as realistic by human evaluators. Methodologically, we investigate two different variations to carry out text rewriting attacks: (1) two-phase fine-tuning for greater attack performance, and (2) in-context learning for higher text rewriting quality. Experiments spanning 3 different datasets and 4 existing approaches demonstrate that recommender systems exhibit vulnerability against the proposed text rewriting attack. Our work adds to the existing literature around the robustness of recommender systems, while highlighting a new dimension of vulnerability in the age of large-scale automated text generation.

**Authors**: Jimmy Z. Di, Jack Douglas, Jayadev Acharya, Gautam Kamath, Ayush Sekhari

**Abstract**: We introduce camouflaged data poisoning attacks, a new attack vector that arises in the context of machine unlearning and other settings when model retraining may be induced. An adversary first adds a few carefully crafted points to the training dataset such that the impact on the model's predictions is minimal. The adversary subsequently triggers a request to remove a subset of the introduced points at which point the attack is unleashed and the model's predictions are negatively affected. In particular, we consider clean-label targeted attacks (in which the goal is to cause the model to misclassify a specific test point) on datasets including CIFAR-10, Imagenette, and Imagewoof. This attack is realized by constructing camouflage datapoints that mask the effect of a poisoned dataset.

**Authors**: Minxing Zhang, Ahmed Salem, Michael Backes, Yang Zhang

**Abstract**: The increasing cost of training machine learning (ML) models has led to the inclusion of new parties to the training pipeline, such as users who contribute training data and companies that provide computing resources. This involvement of such new parties in the ML training process has introduced new attack surfaces for an adversary to exploit. A recent attack in this domain is the model hijacking attack, whereby an adversary hijacks a victim model to implement their own -- possibly malicious -- hijacking tasks. However, the scope of the model hijacking attack is so far limited to the homogeneous-modality tasks. In this paper, we transform the model hijacking attack into a more general multimodal setting, where the hijacking and original tasks are performed on data of different modalities. Specifically, we focus on the setting where an adversary implements a natural language processing (NLP) hijacking task into an image classification model. To mount the attack, we propose a novel encoder-decoder based framework, namely the Blender, which relies on advanced image and language models. Experimental results show that our modal hijacking attack achieves strong performances in different settings. For instance, our attack achieves 94%, 94%, and 95% attack success rate when using the Sogou news dataset to hijack STL10, CIFAR-10, and MNIST classifiers.

**Authors**: Gabriel Loiseau, Damien Sileo, Damien Riquet, Maxime Meyer, Marc Tommasi

**Abstract**: Authorship obfuscation aims to disguise the identity of an author within a text by altering the writing style, vocabulary, syntax, and other linguistic features associated with the text author. This alteration needs to balance privacy and utility. While strong obfuscation techniques can effectively hide the author's identity, they often degrade the quality and usefulness of the text for its intended purpose. Conversely, maintaining high utility tends to provide insufficient privacy, making it easier for an adversary to de-anonymize the author. Thus, achieving an optimal trade-off between these two conflicting objectives is crucial. In this paper, we propose TAROT: Task-Oriented Authorship Obfuscation Using Policy Optimization, a new unsupervised authorship obfuscation method whose goal is to optimize the privacy-utility trade-off by regenerating the entire text considering its downstream utility. Our approach leverages policy optimization as a fine-tuning paradigm over small language models in order to rewrite texts by preserving author identity and downstream task utility. We show that our approach largely reduce the accuracy of attackers while preserving utility. We make our code and models publicly available.

**Authors**: C. A. Martínez-Mejía, J. Solano, J. Breier, D. Bucko, X. Hou

**Abstract**: Machine Learning using neural networks has received prominent attention recently because of its success in solving a wide variety of computational tasks, in particular in the field of computer vision. However, several works have drawn attention to potential security risks involved with the training and implementation of such networks. In this work, we introduce DeepBaR, a novel approach that implants backdoors on neural networks by faulting their behavior at training, especially during fine-tuning. Our technique aims to generate adversarial samples by optimizing a custom loss function that mimics the implanted backdoors while adding an almost non-visible trigger in the image. We attack three popular convolutional neural network architectures and show that DeepBaR attacks have a success rate of up to 98.30\%. Furthermore, DeepBaR does not significantly affect the accuracy of the attacked networks after deployment when non-malicious inputs are given. Remarkably, DeepBaR allows attackers to choose an input that looks similar to a given class, from a human perspective, but that will be classified as belonging to an arbitrary target class.

**Authors**: Maisha Binte Rashid, Pablo Rivas

**Abstract**: Multimodal machine learning models that combine visual and textual data are increasingly being deployed in critical applications, raising significant safety and security concerns due to their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. This paper presents an effective strategy to enhance the robustness of multimodal image captioning models against such attacks. By leveraging the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) to generate adversarial examples and incorporating adversarial training techniques, we demonstrate improved model robustness on two benchmark datasets: Flickr8k and COCO. Our findings indicate that selectively training only the text decoder of the multimodal architecture shows performance comparable to full adversarial training while offering increased computational efficiency. This targeted approach suggests a balance between robustness and training costs, facilitating the ethical deployment of multimodal AI systems across various domains.

**Authors**: Yunfeng Diao, Naixin Zhai, Changtao Miao, Xun Yang, Meng Wang

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in image synthesis, particularly with the advent of GAN and Diffusion models, have amplified public concerns regarding the dissemination of disinformation. To address such concerns, numerous AI-generated Image (AIGI) Detectors have been proposed and achieved promising performance in identifying fake images. However, there still lacks a systematic understanding of the adversarial robustness of these AIGI detectors. In this paper, we examine the vulnerability of state-of-the-art AIGI detectors against adversarial attack under white-box and black-box settings, which has been rarely investigated so far. For the task of AIGI detection, we propose a new attack containing two main parts. First, inspired by the obvious difference between real images and fake images in the frequency domain, we add perturbations under the frequency domain to push the image away from its original frequency distribution. Second, we explore the full posterior distribution of the surrogate model to further narrow this gap between heterogeneous models, e.g. transferring adversarial examples across CNNs and ViTs. This is achieved by introducing a novel post-train Bayesian strategy that turns a single surrogate into a Bayesian one, capable of simulating diverse victim models using one pre-trained surrogate, without the need for re-training. We name our method as frequency-based post-train Bayesian attack, or FPBA. Through FPBA, we show that adversarial attack is truly a real threat to AIGI detectors, because FPBA can deliver successful black-box attacks across models, generators, defense methods, and even evade cross-generator detection, which is a crucial real-world detection scenario.

**Authors**: Simin Li, Jun Guo, Jingqiao Xiu, Yuwei Zheng, Pu Feng, Xin Yu, Aishan Liu, Yaodong Yang, Bo An, Wenjun Wu, Xianglong Liu

**Abstract**: This study probes the vulnerabilities of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (c-MARL) under adversarial attacks, a critical determinant of c-MARL's worst-case performance prior to real-world implementation. Current observation-based attacks, constrained by white-box assumptions, overlook c-MARL's complex multi-agent interactions and cooperative objectives, resulting in impractical and limited attack capabilities. To address these shortcomes, we propose Adversarial Minority Influence (AMI), a practical and strong for c-MARL. AMI is a practical black-box attack and can be launched without knowing victim parameters. AMI is also strong by considering the complex multi-agent interaction and the cooperative goal of agents, enabling a single adversarial agent to unilaterally misleads majority victims to form targeted worst-case cooperation. This mirrors minority influence phenomena in social psychology. To achieve maximum deviation in victim policies under complex agent-wise interactions, our unilateral attack aims to characterize and maximize the impact of the adversary on the victims. This is achieved by adapting a unilateral agent-wise relation metric derived from mutual information, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of victim influence on the adversary. To lead the victims into a jointly detrimental scenario, our targeted attack deceives victims into a long-term, cooperatively harmful situation by guiding each victim towards a specific target, determined through a trial-and-error process executed by a reinforcement learning agent. Through AMI, we achieve the first successful attack against real-world robot swarms and effectively fool agents in simulated environments into collectively worst-case scenarios, including Starcraft II and Multi-agent Mujoco.

**Abstract**: Recent vision-language foundation models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated superior capabilities in learning representations that can be transferable across diverse range of downstream tasks and domains. With the emergence of such powerful models, it has become crucial to effectively leverage their capabilities in tackling challenging vision tasks. On the other hand, only a few works have focused on devising adversarial examples that transfer well to both unknown domains and model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer attack method called PDCL-Attack, which leverages the CLIP model to enhance the transferability of adversarial perturbations generated by a generative model-based attack framework. Specifically, we formulate an effective prompt-driven feature guidance by harnessing the semantic representation power of text, particularly from the ground-truth class labels of input images. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce prompt learning to enhance the transferable generative attacks. Extensive experiments conducted across various cross-domain and cross-model settings empirically validate our approach, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

**Authors**: Hunmin Yang, Jongoh Jeong, Kuk-Jin Yoon

**Abstract**: Deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to security risks due to the inherent transferable nature of adversarial examples. Despite the success of recent generative model-based attacks demonstrating strong transferability, it still remains a challenge to design an efficient attack strategy in a real-world strict black-box setting, where both the target domain and model architectures are unknown. In this paper, we seek to explore a feature contrastive approach in the frequency domain to generate adversarial examples that are robust in both cross-domain and cross-model settings. With that goal in mind, we propose two modules that are only employed during the training phase: a Frequency-Aware Domain Randomization (FADR) module to randomize domain-variant low- and high-range frequency components and a Frequency-Augmented Contrastive Learning (FACL) module to effectively separate domain-invariant mid-frequency features of clean and perturbed image. We demonstrate strong transferability of our generated adversarial perturbations through extensive cross-domain and cross-model experiments, while keeping the inference time complexity.

**Authors**: Zexin Fang, Bin Han, Hans D. Schotten

**Abstract**: Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving collaborative approach for training models in wireless networks, with channel estimation emerging as a promising application. Despite extensive studies on FL-empowered channel estimation, the security concerns associated with FL require meticulous attention. In a scenario where small base stations (SBSs) serve as local models trained on cached data, and a macro base station (MBS) functions as the global model setting, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability of FL, launching attacks with various adversarial attacks or deployment tactics. In this paper, we analyze such vulnerabilities, corresponding solutions were brought forth, and validated through simulation.

**Authors**: Aditya Kulkarni, Vivek Balachandran, Dinil Mon Divakaran, Tamal Das

**Abstract**: Phishing attacks attempt to deceive users into stealing sensitive information, posing a significant cybersecurity threat. Advances in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have led to the development of numerous phishing webpage detection solutions, but these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Evaluating their robustness against adversarial phishing webpages is essential. Existing tools contain datasets of pre-designed phishing webpages for a limited number of brands, and lack diversity in phishing features.   To address these challenges, we develop PhishOracle, a tool that generates adversarial phishing webpages by embedding diverse phishing features into legitimate webpages. We evaluate the robustness of two existing models, Stack model and Phishpedia, in classifying PhishOracle-generated adversarial phishing webpages. Additionally, we study a commercial large language model, Gemini Pro Vision, in the context of adversarial attacks. We conduct a user study to determine whether PhishOracle-generated adversarial phishing webpages deceive users. Our findings reveal that many PhishOracle-generated phishing webpages evade current phishing webpage detection models and deceive users, but Gemini Pro Vision is robust to the attack. We also develop the PhishOracle web app, allowing users to input a legitimate URL, select relevant phishing features and generate a corresponding phishing webpage. All resources are publicly available on GitHub.

**Abstract**: Prompt leakage poses a compelling security and privacy threat in LLM applications. Leakage of system prompts may compromise intellectual property, and act as adversarial reconnaissance for an attacker. A systematic evaluation of prompt leakage threats and mitigation strategies is lacking, especially for multi-turn LLM interactions. In this paper, we systematically investigate LLM vulnerabilities against prompt leakage for 10 closed- and open-source LLMs, across four domains. We design a unique threat model which leverages the LLM sycophancy effect and elevates the average attack success rate (ASR) from 17.7% to 86.2% in a multi-turn setting. Our standardized setup further allows dissecting leakage of specific prompt contents such as task instructions and knowledge documents. We measure the mitigation effect of 7 black-box defense strategies, along with finetuning an open-source model to defend against leakage attempts. We present different combination of defenses against our threat model, including a cost analysis. Our study highlights key takeaways for building secure LLM applications and provides directions for research in multi-turn LLM interactions

**Abstract**: Diffusion-based personalized visual content generation technologies have achieved significant breakthroughs, allowing for the creation of specific objects by just learning from a few reference photos. However, when misused to fabricate fake news or unsettling content targeting individuals, these technologies could cause considerable societal harm. To address this problem, current methods generate adversarial samples by adversarially maximizing the training loss, thereby disrupting the output of any personalized generation model trained with these samples. However, the existing methods fail to achieve effective defense and maintain stealthiness, as they overlook the intrinsic properties of diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce a novel Dual-Domain Anti-Personalization framework (DDAP). Specifically, we have developed Spatial Perturbation Learning (SPL) by exploiting the fixed and perturbation-sensitive nature of the image encoder in personalized generation. Subsequently, we have designed a Frequency Perturbation Learning (FPL) method that utilizes the characteristics of diffusion models in the frequency domain. The SPL disrupts the overall texture of the generated images, while the FPL focuses on image details. By alternating between these two methods, we construct the DDAP framework, effectively harnessing the strengths of both domains. To further enhance the visual quality of the adversarial samples, we design a localization module to accurately capture attentive areas while ensuring the effectiveness of the attack and avoiding unnecessary disturbances in the background. Extensive experiments on facial benchmarks have shown that the proposed DDAP enhances the disruption of personalized generation models while also maintaining high quality in adversarial samples, making it more effective in protecting privacy in practical applications.

Accepted by IJCB 2024

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-29    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19981v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19981v1)

**Authors**: Chao Liu, Xin Liu, Zitong Yu, Yonghong Hou, Huanjing Yue, Jingyu Yang

**Abstract**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been applied in many computer vision tasks and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. However, misclassification will occur when DNNs predict adversarial examples which are created by adding human-imperceptible adversarial noise to natural examples. This limits the application of DNN in security-critical fields. In order to enhance the robustness of models, previous research has primarily focused on the unimodal domain, such as image recognition and video understanding. Although multi-modal learning has achieved advanced performance in various tasks, such as action recognition, research on the robustness of RGB-skeleton action recognition models is scarce. In this paper, we systematically investigate how to improve the robustness of RGB-skeleton action recognition models. We initially conducted empirical analysis on the robustness of different modalities and observed that the skeleton modality is more robust than the RGB modality. Motivated by this observation, we propose the \formatword{A}ttention-based \formatword{M}odality \formatword{R}eweighter (\formatword{AMR}), which utilizes an attention layer to re-weight the two modalities, enabling the model to learn more robust features. Our AMR is plug-and-play, allowing easy integration with multimodal models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of AMR, we conducted extensive experiments on various datasets. For example, compared to the SOTA methods, AMR exhibits a 43.77\% improvement against PGD20 attacks on the NTU-RGB+D 60 dataset. Furthermore, it effectively balances the differences in robustness between different modalities.



## **50. Quasi-Framelets: Robust Graph Neural Networks via Adaptive Framelet Convolution**

cs.LG

**SubmitDate**: 2024-07-29    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04728v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.04728v2)

**Authors**: Mengxi Yang, Dai Shi, Xuebin Zheng, Jie Yin, Junbin Gao

**Abstract**: This paper aims to provide a novel design of a multiscale framelet convolution for spectral graph neural networks (GNNs). While current spectral methods excel in various graph learning tasks, they often lack the flexibility to adapt to noisy, incomplete, or perturbed graph signals, making them fragile in such conditions. Our newly proposed framelet convolution addresses these limitations by decomposing graph data into low-pass and high-pass spectra through a finely-tuned multiscale approach. Our approach directly designs filtering functions within the spectral domain, allowing for precise control over the spectral components. The proposed design excels in filtering out unwanted spectral information and significantly reduces the adverse effects of noisy graph signals. Our approach not only enhances the robustness of GNNs but also preserves crucial graph features and structures. Through extensive experiments on diverse, real-world graph datasets, we demonstrate that our framelet convolution achieves superior performance in node classification tasks. It exhibits remarkable resilience to noisy data and adversarial attacks, highlighting its potential as a robust solution for real-world graph applications. This advancement opens new avenues for more adaptive and reliable spectral GNN architectures.
